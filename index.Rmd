# About this Booklet {-}

The [__Harvard Gov Prefresher__](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/prefresher) is held each year in August. All relevant information is on our website, including the day-to-day schedule. The 2020 Prefresher instructors are [Laura Royden](https://gov.harvard.edu/people/laura-royden) and [Hunter Rendleman](https://hunterrendleman.com), and the faculty sponsor is  [Gary King](https://gking.harvard.edu).

This booklet serves as the text for the Prefresher, available as a [webpage](https://iqss.github.io/prefresher/) updated automatically and as a [printable PDF](https://github.com/IQSS/prefresher/releases) updated manually. It is the product of generations of Prefresher instructors. See below for a full list of instructors and contributors. 

For information about the role of the prefresher (or "math camp") as a introduction to graduate school, you  may also be interested in ["The Math Prefresher and The Collective Future of Political Science Graduate Training"](https://gking.harvard.edu/prefresher), in _PS: Political Science & Politics_, by Gary King, Shiro Kuriwaki, and Yon Soo Park.
