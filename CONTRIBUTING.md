We transitioned the Math Prefresher booklet into a Rmarkdown (bookdown) document and into a public github repo in 2018, so typos, corrections, additional explanations, are especially welcome. 

In 2024, this was again transformed to use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), a next-generation version of RMarkdown. Suggestions, corrections, and contributions are still very welcome.

All changes should be made in the `.qmd` files in the project root.

To contribute a change, please make a pull request. All changes will be automatically checked by GitHub Actions.

To render locally, make sure you have the [Quarto cli](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) installed and run `quarto render`.
