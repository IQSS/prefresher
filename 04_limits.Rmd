# Limits {#limits}

## Example: The Central Limit Theorem {-}

## Dimensionality

${\bf R}^1$ is the set of all real numbers extending from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ --- i.e., the real number line. ${\bf R}^n$ is an $n$-dimensional space (often referred to as Euclidean space), where each of the $n$ axes extends from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.

* ${\bf R}^1$ is a one dimensional line.
* ${\bf R}^2$ is a two dimensional plane.
* ${\bf R}^3$ is a three dimensional space.

Points in ${\bf R}^n$ are ordered $n$-tuples (just means an combination of $n$ elements where order matters), where each element of the $n$-tuple represents the coordinate along that dimension.

* ${\bf R}^1$: (3)
* ${\bf R}^2$: (-15, 5)
* ${\bf R}^3$: (86, 4, 0)


## Interval Notation for ${\bf R}^1$

Open interval: $$(a,b)\equiv \{ x\in{\bf R}^1: a<x<b\}$$

$x$ is a one-dimensional element in which x is greater than a and less than b

Closed interval: $$[a,b]\equiv \{ x\in{\bf R}^1: a\le x \le b\}$$

$x$ is a one-dimensional element in which x is greater or equal to than a and less than  or equal to b

Half open, half closed: $$(a,b]\equiv \{ x\in{\bf R}^1: a<x\le b\}$$

$x$ is a one-dimensional element in which x is greater than a and less than or equal to b


In many areas of math, we need a formal construct for what it means to be "near" a point $\bf c$ in ${\bf R}^n$.  This is generally called the __neighborhood__ of $\bf c$. It's represented by an open interval, disk, or ball, depending on whether ${\bf R}^n$ is of one, two, or more dimensions, respectively.

Given the point $c$, these are defined as

* $\epsilon$-interval in ${\bf R}^1$: $\{x : |x-c|<\epsilon \}$. $x$ is in the neighborhood of {\bf c} if it is in the open interval $(c-\epsilon,c+\epsilon)$.
* $\epsilon$-disk in ${\bf R}^2$: $\{x : || x-c ||<\epsilon\}$. $x$ is in the neighborhood of {\bf c} if it is inside the circle or disc with center $\bf c$ and radius $\epsilon$.
* $\epsilon$-ball in ${\bf R}^n$: $\{x : || x-c ||<\epsilon\}$. $x$ is in the neighborhood of {\bf c} if it is inside the sphere or ball with center $\bf c$ and radius $\epsilon$.


## Limits of a Function {#limitsfun}

We're often interested in determining if a function $f$ approaches some number $L$ as its independent variable $x$ moves to some number $c$ (usually 0 or $\pm\infty$).  If it does, we say that the limit of $f(x)$, as $x$ approaches $c$, is $L$: $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)=L$.
	
For a limit $L$ to exist, the function $f(x)$ must approach $L$ from both the left and right.
	
__Limit of a function__.  Let $f(x)$ be defined at each point in some open interval containing the point $c$.  Then $L$ equals $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)$ if for any (small positive) number $\epsilon$, there exists a corresponding number $\delta>0$ such that if $0<|x-c|<\delta$, then $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$.

Note: f(x) does not necessarily have to be defined at $c$ for $\lim\limits_{x \to c}$ to exist.

__Uniqueness__: $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)=L$ and $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)=M \Longrightarrow L=M$

Properties: Let $f$ and $g$ be functions with $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)=A$ and $\lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x)=B$.


* $\lim\limits_{x \to c}[f(x)+g(x)]=\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)+ \lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x)$
* $\lim\limits_{x \to c} \alpha f(x) = \alpha \lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)$
* $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x) g(x) = [\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)][\lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x)]$
* $\lim\limits_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)}{\lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x)}$, provided $\lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x)\ne 0$.

Note: In a couple days we'll talk about L'H\^opital's Rule, which uses simple calculus to help find the limits of functions like this.

Examples:

\begin{align*}
& \lim_{x \to c} k = \\
& \lim_{x \to c} x = \\
& \lim_{x\to 2} (2x-3) =\\
& \lim_{x \to c} x^n = 
\end{align*}

Types of limits:

1. Right-hand limit: The value approached by $f(x)$ when you move from right to left.
\begin{comment}

		\end{comment}
2. Left-hand limit: The value approached by $f(x)$ when you move from left to right.
3. Infinity: The value approached by $f(x)$ as x grows infinitely large. Sometimes this may be a number; sometimes it might be $\infty$ or $-\infty$.
4. Negative infinity: The value approached by $f(x)$ as x grows infinitely negative. Sometimes this may be a number; sometimes it might be $\infty$ or $-\infty$.

## Continuity

__Continuity__: Suppose that the domain of the function $f$ includes an open interval containing the point $c$.  Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)$ exists and if $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)=f(c)$. Further, $f$ is continuous on an open interval $(a,b)$ if it is continuous at each point in the interval.


Examples: Continuous functions.

\end{comment}

Properties:

1. If $f$ and $g$ are continuous at point $c$, then $f+g$, $f-g$, $f \cdot g$, $|f|$, and $\alpha f$ are continuous at point $c$ also. $f/g$ is continuous, provided $g(c)\ne 0$.
2. Boundedness: If $f$ is continuous on the closed bounded interval $[a,b]$, then there is a number $K$ such that $|f(x)|\le K$ for each $x$ in $[a,b]$.
3. Max/Min: If $f$ is continuous on the closed bounded interval $[a,b]$, then $f$ has a maximum and a minimum on $[a,b]$. They may be located at the end points.


## Sequences

A \textbf{sequence} $\{y_n\}=\{y_1, y_2, y_3, \ldots, y_n\}$ is an ordered set of real numbers, where $y_1$ is the first term in the sequence and $y_n$ is the $n$th term. Generally, a sequence is \textbf{infinite}, that is it extends to $n=\infty$. We can also write the sequence as $\{y_n\}^\infty_{n=1}$.
	

Examples:
\begin{comment}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \parbox[t]{3in}{$\{y_n\}=\left\{ 2-\frac{1}{n^2} \right\} = $}\parbox[t]{1in}{\, {\includegraphics[width=1.5in]{limit.eps}}}
		\item \parbox[t]{3in}{$\{y_n\}=\left\{ \frac{n^2+1}{n} \right\} = $}\parbox[t]{1in}{\,  {\includegraphics[width=1.5in]{unbound.eps}}}
		\item \parbox[t]{3in}{$\{y_n\}=\left\{ (-1)^n \left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right) \right\} = $}\parbox[t]{1in}{\,  {\includegraphics[width=1.5in]{altrnate.eps}}}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{comment}


Think of sequences like functions.  Before, we had $y=f(x)$ with $x$ specified over some domain.  Now we have $\{y_n\}=\{f(n)\}$ with $n=1,2,3,\ldots$.

__Three kinds of sequences__:

1. Sequences like 1 above that converge to a limit.
2. Sequences like 2 above that increase without bound.
3. Sequences like 3 above that neither converge nor increase without bound --- alternating over the number line.

__Boundedness and monotonicity:__

1. \textbf{Bounded}: if $|y_n|\le K$ for all $n$
2. \textbf{Monotonically Increasing}: $y_{n+1}>y_n$ for all $n$
3. \textbf{Monotonically Decreasing}: $y_{n+1}<y_n$ for all $n$

\textbf{Subsequence}: Choose an infinite collection of entries from $\{ y_n \}$, retaining their order.



## The Limit of a Sequence

We're often interested in whether a sequence \textbf{converges} to a \textbf{limit}.  Limits of sequences are conceptually similar to the limits of functions addressed in the previous lecture.

\textbf{Limit of a sequence}.  The sequence $\{y_n\}$ has the limit $L$, that is $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} y_n =L$, if for any $\epsilon>0$ there is an integer $N$ (which depends on $\epsilon$) with the property that $|y_n -L|<\epsilon$ for each $n>N$.  $\{y_n\}$ is said to converge to $L$.  If the above does not hold, then $\{y_n\}$ diverges.

\textbf{Uniqueness}: If $\{y_n\}$ converges, then the limit $L$ is unique.

\underline{Properties:} Let $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} y_n = A$ and $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} z_n =B$.  Then

\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} [\alpha y_n + \beta z_n]=\alpha A+\beta B$
		\item $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} y_n z_n = A B$
		\item $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \frac{y_n}{z_n} = \frac{A}{B}$, provided $B\ne 0$
\end{enumerate}


Examples

\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \left\{ 2-\frac{1}{n^2} 
		\right\} = $
		\item $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \left\{ \frac{4^n}{n!} \right\} 
		= $
\end{enumerate}

Finding the limit of a sequence in ${\bf R}^n$ is similar to that in ${\bf R}^1$.

\textbf{Limit of a sequence of vectors.} The sequence of vectors $\bf \{ y_n \}$ has the limit $\bf L$, that is $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} {\bf y_n}={\bf L}$, if for any $\epsilon$ there is an integer $N$ where $\bf ||y_n-L||<\epsilon$ for each $n>N$.  The sequence of vectors $\bf \{ y_n\}$ is said to converge to the vector $\bf L$ --- and the distances between $\bf y_n$ and $\bf L$ converge to zero.


Think of each coordinate of the vector $\bf y_n$ as being part of its own sequence over $n$.  Then a sequence of vectors in ${\bf R}^n$ converges if and only if all $n$ sequences of its components converge.

Examples:

\begin{enumerate}
		\item The sequence $\{ y_n \}$ where $y_n=\left( \frac{1}{n}, 2-\frac{1}{n^2} \right)$ converges to $(0,2)$.
		\item The sequence $\{ y_n \}$ where $y_n=\left( \frac{1}{n}, (-1)^n \right)$ does not converge, since $\left\{ (-1)^n \right\}$ does not converge.
\end{enumerate}
