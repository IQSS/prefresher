# Limits

## Dimensionality

${\bf R}^1$ is the set of all real numbers extending from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ --- i.e., the real number line. ${\bf R}^n$ is an $n$-dimensional space (often referred to as Euclidean space), where each of the $n$ axes extends from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.

* ${\bf R}^1$ is a one dimensional line.
* ${\bf R}^2$ is a two dimensional plane.
* ${\bf R}^3$ is a three dimensional space.
* ${\bf R}^4$ could be 3-D plus time (or temperature, etc).

Points in ${\bf R}^n$ are ordered $n$-tuples, where each element of the $n$-tuple represents the coordinate along that dimension.

* ${\bf R}^1$: (3)
* ${\bf R}^2$: (-15, 5)
* ${\bf R}^3$: (86, 4, 0)


## Interval Notation for ${\bf R}^1$

Open interval: $$(a,b)\equiv \{ x\in{\bf R}^1: a<x<b\}$$

$x$ is a one-dimensional element in which x is greater than a and less than b

Closed interval: $$[a,b]\equiv \{ x\in{\bf R}^1: a\le x \le b\}$$

$x$ is a one-dimensional element in which x is greater or equal to than a and less than  or equal to b

Half open, half closed: $$(a,b]\equiv \{ x\in{\bf R}^1: a<x\le b\}$$

$x$ is a one-dimensional element in which x is greater than a and less than or equal to b


In many areas of math, we need a formal construct for what it means to be "near" a point $\bf c$ in ${\bf R}^n$.  This is generally called the __neighborhood__ of $\bf c$. It's represented by an open interval, disk, or ball, depending on whether ${\bf R}^n$ is of one, two, or more dimensions, respectively.

Given the point $c$, these are defined as

* $\epsilon$-interval in ${\bf R}^1$: $\{x : |x-c|<\epsilon \}$. $x$ is in the neighborhood of {\bf c} if it is in the open interval $(c-\epsilon,c+\epsilon)$.
* $\epsilon$-disk in ${\bf R}^2$: $\{x : || x-c ||<\epsilon\}$. $x$ is in the neighborhood of {\bf c} if it is inside the circle or disc with center $\bf c$ and radius $\epsilon$.
* $\epsilon$-ball in ${\bf R}^n$: $\{x : || x-c ||<\epsilon\}$. $x$ is in the neighborhood of {\bf c} if it is inside the sphere or ball with center $\bf c$ and radius $\epsilon$.



We're often interested in determining if a function $f$ approaches some number $L$ as its independent variable $x$ moves to some number $c$ (usually 0 or $\pm\infty$).  If it does, we say that the limit of $f(x)$, as $x$ approaches $c$, is $L$: $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)=L$.
	
For a limit $L$ to exist, the function $f(x)$ must approach $L$ from both the left and right.
	
__Limit of a function__.  Let $f(x)$ be defined at each point in some open interval containing the point $c$.  Then $L$ equals $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)$ if for any (small positive) number $\epsilon$, there exists a corresponding number $\delta>0$ such that if $0<|x-c|<\delta$, then $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$.

Note: f(x) does not necessarily have to be defined at $c$ for $\lim\limits_{x \to c}$ to exist.

__Uniqueness__: $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)=L$ and $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)=M \Longrightarrow L=M$

Properties: Let $f$ and $g$ be functions with $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)=A$ and $\lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x)=B$.


* $\lim\limits_{x \to c}[f(x)+g(x)]=\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)+ \lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x)$
* $\lim\limits_{x \to c} \alpha f(x) = \alpha \lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)$
* $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x) g(x) = [\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)][\lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x)]$
* $\lim\limits_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)}{\lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x)}$, provided $\lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x)\ne 0$.

Note: In a couple days we'll talk about L'H\^opital's Rule, which uses simple calculus to help find the limits of functions like this.

Examples:

\begin{align*}
& \lim_{x \to c} k = \\
& \lim_{x \to c} x = \\
& \lim_{x\to 2} (2x-3) =\\
& \lim_{x \to c} x^n = 
\end{align*}

Types of limits:

1. Right-hand limit: The value approached by $f(x)$ when you move from right to left.
\begin{comment}
		\parbox[t]{2in}{Example:  $\lim\limits_{x\to 0^+} \sqrt{x} = 0$}\parbox[t]{1in}{\,  {\includegraphics[width=1in, angle = 270]{sqrt.eps}}}
		\end{comment}
2. Left-hand limit: The value approached by $f(x)$ when you move from left to right.
3. Infinity: The value approached by $f(x)$ as x grows infinitely large. Sometimes this may be a number; sometimes it might be $\infty$ or $-\infty$.
4. Negative infinity: The value approached by $f(x)$ as x grows infinitely negative. Sometimes this may be a number; sometimes it might be $\infty$ or $-\infty$.

## Continuity

__Continuity__: Suppose that the domain of the function $f$ includes an open interval containing the point $c$.  Then $f$ is continuous at $c$ if $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)$ exists and if $\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)=f(c)$. Further, $f$ is continuous on an open interval $(a,b)$ if it is continuous at each point in the interval.


Examples: Continuous functions.

Properties:

1. If $f$ and $g$ are continuous at point $c$, then $f+g$, $f-g$, $f \cdot g$, $|f|$, and $\alpha f$ are continuous at point $c$ also. $f/g$ is continuous, provided $g(c)\ne 0$.
2. Boundedness: If $f$ is continuous on the closed bounded interval $[a,b]$, then there is a number $K$ such that $|f(x)|\le K$ for each $x$ in $[a,b]$.
3. Max/Min: If $f$ is continuous on the closed bounded interval $[a,b]$, then $f$ has a maximum and a minimum on $[a,b]$. They may be located at the end points.
