    "text": "1.2 Introduction to Functions\nA function (in \\({\\bf R}^1\\)) is a mapping, or transformation, that relates members of one set to members of another set. For instance, if you have two sets: set \\(A\\) and set \\(B\\), a function from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) maps every value \\(a\\) in set \\(A\\) such that \\(f(a) \\in  B\\). Functions can be “many-to-one”, where many values or combinations of values from set \\(A\\) produce a single output in set \\(B\\), or they can be “one-to-one”, where each value in set \\(A\\) corresponds to a single value in set \\(B\\). A function by definition has a single function value for each element of its domain. This means, there cannot be “one-to-many” mapping.\nDimensionality: \\({\\bf R}^1\\) is the set of all real numbers extending from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\) — i.e., the real number line. \\({\\bf R}^n\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional space, where each of the \\(n\\) axes extends from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\).\n\n\\({\\bf R}^1\\) is a one dimensional line.\n\\({\\bf R}^2\\) is a two dimensional plane.\n\\({\\bf R}^3\\) is a three dimensional space.\n\nPoints in \\({\\bf R}^n\\) are ordered \\(n\\)-tuples (just means an combination of \\(n\\) elements where order matters), where each element of the \\(n\\)-tuple represents the coordinate along that dimension.\nFor example:\n\n\\({\\bf R}^1\\): (3)\n\\({\\bf R}^2\\): (-15, 5)\n\\({\\bf R}^3\\): (86, 4, 0)\n\nExamples of mapping notation:\nFunction of one variable: \\(f:{\\bf R}^1\\to{\\bf R}^1\\)\n\n\\(f(x)=x+1\\). For each \\(x\\) in \\({\\bf R}^1\\), \\(f(x)\\) assigns the number \\(x+1\\).\n\nFunction of two variables: \\(f: {\\bf R}^2\\to{\\bf R}^1\\).\n\n\\(f(x,y)=x^2+y^2\\). For each ordered pair \\((x,y)\\) in \\({\\bf R}^2\\), \\(f(x,y)\\) assigns the number \\(x^2+y^2\\).\n\nWe often use variable \\(x\\) as input and another \\(y\\) as output, e.g. \\(y=x+1\\)\n\nExample 1.2 (Functions) For each of the following, state whether they are one-to-one or many-to-one functions.\n\nFor \\(x \\in [0,\\infty]\\), \\(f : x \\rightarrow x^2\\) (this could also be written as \\(f(x) = x^2\\)).\nFor \\(x \\in [-\\infty, \\infty]\\), \\(f: x \\rightarrow x^2\\).\n\n\n\nExercise 1.2 (Functions) For each of the following, state whether they are one-to-one or many-to-one functions.\n\nFor \\(x \\in [-3, \\infty]\\), \\(f: x \\rightarrow x^2\\).\nFor \\(x \\in [0, \\infty]\\), \\(f: x \\rightarrow \\sqrt{x}\\)\n\n\nSome functions are defined only on proper subsets of \\({\\bf R}^n\\).\n\nDomain: the set of numbers in \\(X\\) at which \\(f(x)\\) is defined.\nRange: elements of \\(Y\\) assigned by \\(f(x)\\) to elements of \\(X\\), or \\[f(X)=\\{ y : y=f(x), x\\in X\\}\\] Most often used when talking about a function \\(f:{\\bf R}^1\\to{\\bf R}^1\\).\nImage: same as range, but more often used when talking about a function \\(f:{\\bf R}^n\\to{\\bf R}^1\\).\n\nSome General Types of Functions\nMonomials: \\(f(x)=a x^k\\)\n\\(a\\) is the coefficient. \\(k\\) is the degree.\nExamples: \\(y=x^2\\), \\(y=-\\frac{1}{2}x^3\\)\nPolynomials: sum of monomials.\nExamples: \\(y=-\\frac{1}{2}x^3+x^2\\), \\(y=3x+5\\)\nThe degree of a polynomial is the highest degree of its monomial terms.

First we will introduce a “sequence”, then we will think about the limit of a sequence, then we will think about the limit of a function.\nA sequence \\[\\{x_n\\}=\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_n\\}\\] is an ordered set of real numbers, where \\(x_1\\) is the first term in the sequence and \\(y_n\\) is the \\(n\\)th term.

    "text": "2.2 The Limit of a Sequence\nThe notion of “converging to a limit” is the behavior of the points in Example Example 2.1. In some sense, that’s the counterfactual we want to know. What happens as \\(n\\rightarrow \\infty\\)?\n\nSequences like 1 above that converge to a limit.\nSequences like 2 above that increase without bound.\nSequences like 3 above that neither converge nor increase without bound — alternating over the number line.\n\n\nDefinition 2.1 The sequence \\(\\{y_n\\}\\) has the limit \\(L\\), which we write as \\[\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} y_n =L\\], if for any \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\) there is an integer \\(N\\) (which depends on \\(\\epsilon\\)) with the property that \\(|y_n -L|&lt;\\epsilon\\) for each \\(n&gt;N\\). \\(\\{y_n\\}\\) is said to converge to \\(L\\). If the above does not hold, then \\(\\{y_n\\}\\) diverges.\n\nWe can also express the behavior of a sequence as bounded or not:\n\nBounded: if \\(|y_n|\\le K\\) for all \\(n\\)\nMonotonically Increasing: \\(y_{n+1}&gt;y_n\\) for all \\(n\\)\nMonotonically Decreasing: \\(y_{n+1}&lt;y_n\\) for all \\(n\\)\n\nA limit is unique: If \\(\\{y_n\\}\\) converges, then the limit \\(L\\) is unique.\nIf a sequence converges, then the sum of such sequences also converges. Let \\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} y_n = y\\) and \\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} z_n =z\\). Then\n\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} [k y_n + \\ell z_n]= k y + \\ell z\\)\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} y_n z_n = yz\\)\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{y_n}{z_n} = \\frac{y}{z}\\), provided \\(z\\neq 0\\)\n\nThis looks reasonable enough. The harder question, obviously is when the parts of the fraction don’t converge. If \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y_n = \\infty\\) and \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} z_n = \\infty\\), What is \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} y_n - z_n\\)? What is \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{y_n}{z_n}\\)?\nIt is nice for a sequence to converge in limit. We want to know if complex-looking sequences converge or not. The name of the game here is to break that complex sequence up into sums of simple fractions where \\(n\\) only appears in the denominator: \\(\\frac{1}{n}, \\frac{1}{n^2}\\), and so on. Each of these will converge to 0, because the denominator gets larger and larger. Then, because of the properties above, we can then find the final sequence.\n\nExample 2.2 (Simplifying a Fraction into Sums) Find the limit of \\[\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\frac{n + 3}{n},\\]\n\n\nSolution 2.1. At first glance, \\(n + 3\\) and \\(n\\) both grow to \\(\\infty\\), so it looks like we need to divide infinity by infinity. However, we can express this fraction as a sum, then the limits apply separately:\n\\[\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\frac{n + 3}{n} = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{3}{n}\\right) =  \\underbrace{\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}1}_{1} +  \\underbrace{\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\left(\\frac{3}{n}\\right)}_{0}\\]\nso, the limit is actually 1.\n\nAfter some practice, the key to intuition is whether one part of the fraction grows “faster” than another. If the denominator grows faster to infinity than the numerator, then the fraction will converge to 0, even if the numerator will also increase to infinity. In a sense, limits show how not all infinities are the same.\n\nExercise 2.1 Find the following limits of sequences, then explain in English the intuition for why that is the case.\n\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{2n}{n^2 + 1}\\)\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{n\\to\\infty} (n^3 - 100n^2)\\)",

    "text": "2.3 Limits of a Function\nWe’ve now covered functions and just covered limits of sequences, so now is the time to combine the two.\nA function \\(f\\) is a compact representation of some behavior we care about. Like for sequences, we often want to know if \\(f(x)\\) approaches some number \\(L\\) as its independent variable \\(x\\) moves to some number \\(c\\) (which is usually 0 or \\(\\pm\\infty\\)). If it does, we say that the limit of \\(f(x)\\), as \\(x\\) approaches \\(c\\), is \\(L\\): \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)=L\\). Unlike a sequence, \\(x\\) is a continuous number, and we can move in decreasing order as well as increasing.\nFor a limit \\(L\\) to exist, the function \\(f(x)\\) must approach \\(L\\) from both the left (increasing) and the right (decreasing).\n\nDefinition 2.2 (Limit of a function) Let \\(f(x)\\) be defined at each point in some open interval containing the point \\(c\\).

First, the functions may become large polynomials with many moving pieces. Second,the functions may become discontinuous.\nThe function can be thought of as a more general or “smooth” version of sequences. For example,\n\nExercise 2.2 (Limits of a Fraction of Functions) Find the limit of\n\\[\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{(x^4 +3x−99)(2−x^5)}{(18x^7 +9x^6 −3x^2 −1)(x+1)}\\]\n\nNow, the functions will become a bit more complex:\n\nExercise 2.3 Solve the following limits of functions\n\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0} |x|\\)\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{x\\to 0} \\left(1+\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right)\\)\n\n\nSo there are a few more alternatives about what a limit of a function could be:\n\nRight-hand limit: The value approached by \\(f(x)\\) when you move from right to left.\nLeft-hand limit: The value approached by \\(f(x)\\) when you move from left to right.\nInfinity: The value approached by \\(f(x)\\) as x grows infinitely large. Sometimes this may be a number; sometimes it might be \\(\\infty\\) or \\(-\\infty\\).\nNegative infinity: The value approached by \\(f(x)\\) as x grows infinitely negative.

Functions that have breaks in their lines are called discontinuous. Functions that have no breaks are called continuous. Continuity is a concept that is more fundamental to, but related to that of “differentiability”, which we will cover next in calculus.\n\nDefinition 2.3 (Continuity) Suppose that the domain of the function \\(f\\) includes an open interval containing the point \\(c\\). Then \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(c\\) if \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)\\) exists and if \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to c} f(x)=f(c)\\). Further, \\(f\\) is continuous on an open interval \\((a,b)\\) if it is continuous at each point in the interval.\n\nTo prove that a function is continuous for all points is beyond this practical introduction to math, but the general intuition can be grasped by graphing.\n\nExample 2.4 (Continuous and Discontinuous Functions) For each function, determine if it is continuous or discontinuous.\n\n\\(f(x) = \\sqrt{x}\\)\n\\(f(x) = e^x\\)\n\\(f(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{x^2}\\)\n\\(f(x) = \\text{floor}(x)\\).\n\nThe floor is the smaller of the two integers bounding a number.

In Figure Figure 2.3, we can see that the first two functions are continuous, and the next two are discontinuous. \\(f(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{x^2}\\) is discontinuous at \\(x= 0\\), and \\(f(x) = \\text{floor}(x)\\) is discontinuous at each whole number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Continuous and Discontinuous Functions\n\n\n\n\n\nSome properties of continuous functions:\n\nIf \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are continuous at point \\(c\\), then \\(f+g\\), \\(f-g\\), \\(f \\cdot g\\), \\(|f|\\), and \\(\\alpha f\\) are continuous at point \\(c\\) also. \\(f/g\\) is continuous, provided \\(g(c)\\ne 0\\).\nBoundedness: If \\(f\\) is continuous on the closed bounded interval \\([a,b]\\), then there is a number \\(K\\) such that \\(|f(x)|\\le K\\) for each \\(x\\) in \\([a,b]\\).\nMax/Min: If \\(f\\) is continuous on the closed bounded interval \\([a,b]\\), then \\(f\\) has a maximum and a minimum on \\([a,b]\\).

    "text": "3.1 Derivatives\nThe derivative of \\(f\\) at \\(x\\) is its rate of change at \\(x\\): how much \\(f(x)\\) changes with a change in \\(x\\). The rate of change is a fraction — rise over run — but because not all lines are straight and the rise over run formula will give us different values depending on the range we examine, we need to take a limit (Section Chapter 2).\n\nDefinition 3.1 (Derivative) Let \\(f\\) be a function whose domain includes an open interval containing the point \\(x\\). The derivative of \\(f\\) at \\(x\\) is given by\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}f(x) =\\lim\\limits_{h\\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{(x+h)-x} = \\lim\\limits_{h\\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\\]\nThere are a two main ways to denote a derivative:\n\nLeibniz Notation: \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(f(x))\\)\nPrime or Lagrange Notation: \\(f'(x)\\)\n\n\nIf \\(f(x)\\) is a straight line, the derivative is the slope. For a curve, the slope changes by the values of \\(x\\), so the derivative is the slope of the line tangent to the curve at \\(x\\). See, For example, Figure Figure 3.1.\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: The Derivative as a Slope\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(f'(x)\\) exists at a point \\(x_0\\), then \\(f\\) is said to be differentiable at \\(x_0\\). That also implies that \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x_0\\).\n\nProperties of derivatives\nSuppose that \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are differentiable at \\(x\\) and that \\(\\alpha\\) is a constant. Then the functions \\(f\\pm g\\), \\(\\alpha f\\), \\(f g\\), and \\(f/g\\) (provided \\(g(x)\\ne 0\\)) are also differentiable at \\(x\\). Additionally,\nConstant rule: \\[\\left[k f(x)\\right]' = k f'(x)\\]\nSum rule: \\[\\left[f(x)\\pm g(x)\\right]' = f'(x)\\pm g'(x)\\]\nWith a bit more algebra, we can apply the definition of derivatives to get a formula for of the derivative of a product and a derivative of a quotient.\nProduct rule: \\[\\left[f(x)g(x)\\right]^\\prime = f^\\prime(x)g(x)+f(x)g^\\prime(x)\\]\nQuotient rule: \\[\\left[f(x)/g(x)\\right]^\\prime = \\frac{f^\\prime(x)g(x) - f(x)g^\\prime(x)}{[g(x)]^2}, ~g(x)\\neq 0\\]\nFinally, one way to think of the power of derivatives is that it takes a function a notch down in complexity. The power rule applies to any higher-order function:\nPower rule: \\[\\left[x^k\\right]^\\prime = k x^{k-1}\\]\nFor any real number \\(k\\) (that is, both whole numbers and fractions). The power rule is proved by induction, a neat method of proof used in many fundamental applications to prove that a general statement holds for every possible case, even if there are countably infinite cases. We’ll show a simple case where \\(k\\) is an integer here.\n\nProof (Proof of Power Rule by Induction). We would like to prove that\n\\[\\left[x^k\\right]^\\prime = k x^{k-1}\\] for any integer \\(k\\).\nFirst, consider the first case (the base case) of \\(k = 1\\). We can show by the definition of derivatives (setting \\(f(x) = x^1 = 1\\)) that\n\\[[x^1]^\\prime = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{(x + h) - x}{(x + h) - x}= 1.\\]\nBecause \\(1\\) is also expressed as \\(1 x^{1- 1}\\), the statement we want to prove holds for the case \\(k =1\\).\nNow, that the statement holds for some integer \\(m\\). That is, assume \\[\\left[x^m\\right]^\\prime = m x^{m-1}\\]\nThen, for the case \\(m + 1\\), using the product rule above, we can simplify\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\left[x^{m + 1}\\right]^\\prime &= [x^{m}\\cdot x]^\\prime\\\\\n&= (x^m)^\\prime\\cdot x + (x^m)\\cdot (x)^\\prime\\\\\n&= m x^{m - 1}\\cdot x + x^m ~~\\because \\text{by previous assumption}\\\\\n&= mx^m + x^m\\\\\n&= (m + 1)x^m\\\\\n&= (m + 1)x^{(m + 1) - 1}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nTherefore, the rule holds for the case \\(k = m + 1\\) once we have assumed it holds for \\(k = m\\). Combined with the first case, this completes proof by induction – we have now proved that the statement holds for all integers \\(k = 1, 2, 3, \\cdots\\).\nTo show that it holds for real fractions as well, we can prove expressing that exponent by a fraction of two integers.\n\nThese “rules” become apparent by applying the definition of the derivative above to each of the things to be “derived”, but these come up so frequently that it is best to repeat until it is muscle memory.\n\nExercise 3.1 (Derivative of Polynomials) For each of the following functions, find the first-order derivative \\(f^\\prime(x)\\).\n\n\\(f(x)=c\\)\n\\(f(x)=x\\)\n\\(f(x)=x^2\\)\n\\(f(x)=x^3\\)\n\\(f(x)=\\frac{1}{x^2}\\)\n\\(f(x)=(x^3)(2x^4)\\)\n\\(f(x) = x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1\\)\n\\(f(x) = (x^2 + 1)(x^3 - 1)\\)\n\\(f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x^{1/3}\\)\n\\(f(x)=\\frac{x^2+1}{x^2-1}\\)",

Instead, they will be functions of functions. For example, the difference between \\(x^2 + 1^2\\) and \\((x^2 + 1)^2\\) may look trivial, but the sum rule can be easily applied to the former, while it’s actually not obvious what do with the latter.\nComposite functions are formed by substituting one function into another and are denoted by \\[(f\\circ g)(x)=f[g(x)].\\] To form \\(f[g(x)]\\), the range of \\(g\\) must be contained (at least in part) within the domain of \\(f\\). The domain of \\(f\\circ g\\) consists of all the points in the domain of \\(g\\) for which \\(g(x)\\) is in the domain of \\(f\\).\n\nExample 3.2 Let \\(f(x)=\\log x\\) for \\(0&lt;x&lt;\\infty\\) and \\(g(x)=x^2\\) for \\(-\\infty&lt;x&lt;\\infty\\).\nThen \\[(f\\circ g)(x)=\\log x^2, -\\infty&lt;x&lt;\\infty - \\{0\\}\\]\nAlso \\[(g\\circ f)(x)=[\\log x]^2, 0&lt;x&lt;\\infty\\]\nNotice that \\(f\\circ g\\) and \\(g\\circ f\\) are not the same functions.\n\nWith the notation of composite functions in place, now we can introduce a helpful additional rule that will deal with a derivative of composite functions as a chain of concentric derivatives.\nChain Rule:\nLet \\(y=(f\\circ g)(x)= f[g(x)]\\). The derivative of \\(y\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is \\[\\frac{d}{dx} \\{ f[g(x)] \\} = f'[g(x)] g'(x)\\]\nWe can read this as: “the derivative of the composite function \\(y\\) is the derivative of \\(f\\) evaluated at \\(g(x)\\), times the derivative of \\(g\\).”\nThe chain rule can be thought of as the derivative of the “outside” times the derivative of the “inside”, remembering that the derivative of the outside function is evaluated at the value of the inside function.\n\nThe chain rule can also be written as \\[\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{dy}{dg(x)} \\frac{dg(x)}{dx}\\] This expression does not imply that the \\(dg(x)\\)’s cancel out, as in fractions.

We refer to \\(F\\) as the antiderivative of \\(f\\).\n\nDefinition 3.2 (Antiderivative) The antiverivative of a function \\(f(x)\\) is a differentiable function \\(F\\) whose derivative is \\(f\\).\n\\[F^\\prime = f.\\]\n\nAnother way to describe is through the inverse formula. Let \\(DF\\) be the derivative of \\(F\\). And let \\(DF(x)\\) be the derivative of \\(F\\) evaluated at \\(x\\). Then the antiderivative is denoted by \\(D^{-1}\\) (i.e., the inverse derivative).

We will find, perhaps remarkably, that the formula we find to get the sum turns out to be expressible by the anti-derivative.\nSuppose we want to determine the area \\(A(R)\\) of a region \\(R\\) defined by a curve \\(f(x)\\) and some interval \\(a\\le x \\le b\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: The Riemann Integral as a Sum of Evaluations\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way to calculate the area would be to divide the interval \\(a\\le x\\le b\\) into \\(n\\) subintervals of length \\(\\Delta x\\) and then approximate the region with a series of rectangles, where the base of each rectangle is \\(\\Delta x\\) and the height is \\(f(x)\\) at the midpoint of that interval. \\(A(R)\\) would then be approximated by the area of the union of the rectangles, which is given by \\[S(f,\\Delta x)=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\\Delta x\\] and is called a Riemann sum.\nAs we decrease the size of the subintervals \\(\\Delta x\\), making the rectangles “thinner,” we would expect our approximation of the area of the region to become closer to the true area. This allows us to express the area as a limit of a series: \\[A(R)=\\lim\\limits_{\\Delta x\\to 0}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\\Delta x\\]\nFigure Figure 3.5 shows that illustration. The curve depicted is \\(f(x) = -15(x - 5) + (x - 5)^3 + 50.\\) We want approximate the area under the curve between the \\(x\\) values of 0 and 10. We can do this in blocks of arbitrary width, where the sum of rectangles (the area of which is width times \\(f(x)\\) evaluated at the midpoint of the bar) shows the Riemann Sum. As the width of the bars \\(\\Delta x\\) becomes smaller, the better the estimate of \\(A(R)\\).\nThis is how we define the “Definite” Integral:\n\nDefinition 3.4 (The Definite Integral (Riemann)) If for a given function \\(f\\) the Riemann sum approaches a limit as \\(\\Delta x \\to 0\\), then that limit is called the Riemann integral of \\(f\\) from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\). We express this with the \\(\\int\\), symbol, and write \\[\\int\\limits_a^b f(x) dx= \\lim\\limits_{\\Delta x\\to 0} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\\Delta x\\]\nThe most straightforward of a definite integral is the definite integral. That is, we read \\[\\int\\limits_a^b f(x) dx\\] as the definite integral of \\(f\\) from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) and we defined as the area under the “curve” \\(f(x)\\) from point \\(x=a\\) to \\(x=b\\).\n\nThe fundamental theorem of calculus shows us that this sum is, in fact, the antiderivative.\n\nTheorem 3.2 (First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus) Let the function \\(f\\) be bounded on \\([a,b]\\) and continuous on \\((a,b)\\). Then, suggestively, use the symbol \\(F(x)\\) to denote the definite integral from \\(a\\) to \\(x\\): \\[F(x)=\\int\\limits_a^x f(t)dt, \\quad a\\le x\\le b\\]\nThen \\(F(x)\\) has a derivative at each point in \\((a,b)\\) and \\[F^\\prime(x)=f(x), \\quad a&lt;x&lt;b\\] That is, the definite integral function of \\(f\\) is the one of the antiderivatives of some \\(f\\).\n\nThis is again a long way of saying that that differentiation is the inverse of integration. But now, we’ve covered definite integrals.\nThe second theorem gives us a simple way of computing a definite integral as a function of indefinite integrals.\n\nTheorem 3.3 (Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus) Let the function \\(f\\) be bounded on \\([a,b]\\) and continuous on \\((a,b)\\). Let \\(F\\) be any function that is continuous on \\([a,b]\\) such that \\(F^\\prime(x)=f(x)\\) on \\((a,b)\\). Then \\[\\int\\limits_a^bf(x)dx = F(b)-F(a)\\]\n\nSo the procedure to calculate a simple definite integral \\(\\int\\limits_a^b f(x)dx\\) is then\n\nFind the indefinite integral \\(F(x)\\).\nEvaluate \\(F(b)-F(a)\\).\n\n\nExample 3.9 (Definite Integral of a monomial) Solve \\(\\int\\limits_1^3 3x^2 dx.\\)\nLet \\(f(x) = 3x^2\\).\n\n\nExercise 3.4 What is the value of \\(\\int\\limits_{-2}^2 e^x e^{e^x} dx\\)?\n\n\nCommon Rules for Definite Integrals\nThe area-interpretation of the definite integral provides some rules for simplification.\n\nThere is no area below a point: \\[\\int\\limits_a^a f(x)dx=0\\]\nReversing the limits changes the sign of the integral: \\[\\int\\limits_a^b f(x)dx=-\\int\\limits_b^a f(x)dx\\]\nSums can be separated into their own integrals: \\[\\int\\limits_a^b [\\alpha f(x)+\\beta g(x)]dx = \\alpha \\int\\limits_a^b f(x)dx + \\beta \\int\\limits_a^b g(x)dx\\]\nAreas can be combined as long as limits are linked: \\[\\int\\limits_a^b f(x) dx +\\int\\limits_b^c f(x)dx = \\int\\limits_a^c f(x)dx\\]\n\n\nExercise 3.5 (Definite integral shortcuts) Simplify the following definite integrals.\n\n\\(\\int\\limits_1^1 3x^2 dx =\\)\n\\(\\int\\limits_0^4 (2x+1)dx=\\)\n\\(\\int\\limits_{-2}^0 e^x e^{e^x} dx + \\int\\limits_0^2 e^x e^{e^x} dx =\\)",

    "text": "3.9 Integration by Substitution\nFrom the second fundamental theorem of calculus, we now that a quick way to get a definite integral is to first find the indefinite integral, and then just plug in the bounds.\nSometimes the integrand (the thing that we are trying to take an integral of) doesn’t appear integrable using common rules and antiderivatives. A method one might try is integration by substitution, which is related to the Chain Rule.\nSuppose we want to find the indefinite integral \\[\\int g(x)dx\\] but \\(g(x)\\) is complex and none of the formulas we have seen so far seem to apply immediately. The trick is to come up with a new function \\(u(x)\\) such that \\[g(x)=f[u(x)]u'(x).\\]\nWhy does an introduction of yet another function end of simplifying things? Let’s refer to the antiderivative of \\(f\\) as \\(F\\). Then the chain rule tells us that \\[\\frac{d}{dx} F[u(x)]=f[u(x)]u'(x)\\]. So, \\(F[u(x)]\\) is the antiderivative of \\(g\\). We can then write \\[\\int g(x) dx= \\int f[u(x)]u'(x)dx = \\int \\frac{d}{dx} F[u(x)]dx = F[u(x)]+c\\]\nTo summarize, the procedure to determine the indefinite integral \\(\\int g(x)dx\\) by the method of substitution:\n\nIdentify some part of \\(g(x)\\) that might be simplified by substituting in a single variable \\(u\\) (which will then be a function of \\(x\\)).\nDetermine if \\(g(x)dx\\) can be reformulated in terms of \\(u\\) and \\(du\\).\nSolve the indefinite integral.\nSubstitute back in for \\(x\\)\n\nSubstitution can also be used to calculate a definite integral. Using the same procedure as above, \\[\\int\\limits_a^b g(x)dx=\\int\\limits_c^d f(u)du = F(d)-F(c)\\] where \\(c=u(a)\\) and \\(d=u(b)\\).\n\nExample 3.10 (Integration by Substitution I) Solve the indefinite integral \\[\\int x^2 \\sqrt{x+1}dx.\\]\n\nFor the above problem, we could have also used the substitution \\(u=\\sqrt{x+1}\\). Then \\(x=u^2-1\\) and \\(dx=2u du\\). Substituting these in, we get \\[\\int x^2\\sqrt{x+1}dx=\\int (u^2-1)^2 u 2u du\\] which when expanded is again a polynomial and gives the same result as above.\nAnother case in which integration by substitution is is useful is with a fraction.\n\nExample 3.11 (Integration by Substitutiton II) Simplify \\[\\int\\limits_0^1 \\frac{5e^{2x}}{(1+e^{2x})^{1/3}}dx.\\]",

    "text": "Example: Meltzer-Richard\nA standard backdrop in comparative political economy, the Meltzer-Richard (1981) model states that redistribution of wealth should be higher in societies where the median income is much smaller than the average income. More to the point, typically income distributions wher ethe median is very different from the average is one of high inequality. In other words, the Meltzer-Richard model says that highly unequal economies will have more re-distribution of wealth. Why is that the case? Here is a simplified example that is not the exact model by Meltzer and Richard1, but adapted from Persson and Tabellini2\nWe will set the following things about our model human and model democracy.\nAlso, the government is democratically elected and sets the following redistribution output:\nSuppose an individual’s welfare is given by: \\[W_i = c_i + U(g)\\]\nThe consumption good is the person’s post-tax income.\n\\[c_i = (1 - \\tau) y_i\\]\nIncome varies by person (In the next section we will cover probability, by then we will know that we can express this by saying that \\(y\\) is a random variable with the cumulative distribution function \\(F\\), i.e. \\(y \\sim F\\).). Every distribution has a mean and an median.\nWhat will happen in this economy? What will the tax rate be set too? How much public goods will be provided?\nWe’ve skipped ahead of some formal theory results of demoracy, but hopefully these are conceptually intuitive. First, if a democracy is competitive, there is no slack in the government’s goods, and all tax revenue becomes a public good. So we can go ahead and set the constraint:\n\\[g = \\sum_{i} \\tau y_i P(y_i) = \\tau E(y)\\]\nWe can do this trick because of the “normalizes to unity” setting, but this is a general property of the average.\nNow given this constraint we can re-write an individual’s welfare as\nWhen is the individual’s welfare maximized, as a function of the public good? \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d}{dg}W_i &=  - \\frac{y_i}{E(y)} + \\frac{d}{dg}U(g)\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\\(\\frac{d}{dg}W_i = 0\\) when \\(\\frac{d}{dg}U(g) = \\frac{y_i}{E(y)}\\), and so after expressing the derivative as \\(U_g = \\frac{d}{dg}U(g)\\) for simplicity,\n\\[g_i^\\star = {U_g}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y_i}{E(y)}\\right)\\]\nNow recall that because we assumed concavity, \\(U_g\\) is a negative sloping function whose value is positive. It can be shown that the inverse of such a function is also decreasing. Thus an individual’s preferred level of government is determined by a single continuum, the person’s income divided by the average income, and the function is decreasing in \\(y_i\\). This is consistent with our intuition that richer people prefer less redistribution.\nThat was the amount for any given person. The government has to set one value of \\(g\\), however. So what will that be? Now we will use another result, the median voter theorem. This says that under certain general electoral conditions (single-peaked preferences, two parties, majority rule), the policy winner will be that preferred by the median person in the population. Because the only thing that determines a person’s preferred level of government is \\(y_i / E(y)\\), we can presume that the median voter, whose income is \\(\\text{med}(y)\\) will prevail in their preferred choice of government. Therefore, we will see\n\\[g^\\star = {U_g}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\text{med}(y)}{E(y)}\\right)\\]\nWhat does this say about the level of redistribution we observe in an economy? The higher the average income is than the median income, which often (but not always) means more inequality, there should be more redistribution.",

    "text": "4.3 FOC and SOC\nWe can see from a graphical representation that if a point is a local maxima or minima, it must meet certain conditions regarding its derivative. These are so commonly used that we refer these to “First Order Conditions” (FOCs) and “Second Order Conditions” (SOCs) in the economic tradition.\n\nFirst Order Conditions\nWhen we examined functions of one variable \\(x\\), we found critical points by taking the first derivative, setting it to zero, and solving for \\(x\\). For functions of \\(n\\) variables, the critical points are found in much the same way, except now we set the partial derivatives equal to zero. Note: We will only consider critical points on the interior of a function’s domain.\nIn a derivative, we only took the derivative with respect to one variable at a time. When we take the derivative separately with respect to all variables in the elements of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and then express the result as a vector, we use the term Gradient and Hessian.\n\nDefinition 4.5 (Gradient) Given a function \\(f(\\textbf{x})\\) in \\(n\\) variables, the gradient \\(\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x})\\) (the greek letter nabla ) is a column vector, where the \\(i\\)th element is the partial derivative of \\(f(\\textbf{x})\\) with respect to \\(x_i\\):\n\\[\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_1}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_2}\\\\\n  \\vdots \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_n} \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nBefore we know whether a point is a maxima or minima, if it meets the FOC it is a “Critical Point”.\n\nDefinition 4.6 (Critical Point) \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) is a critical point if and only if \\(\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}^*)=0\\). If the partial derivative of f(x) with respect to \\(x^*\\) is 0, then \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) is a critical point. To solve for \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\), find the gradient, set each element equal to 0, and solve the system of equations. \\[\\mathbf{x}^* = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1^*\\\\x_2^*\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_n^*\\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\n\nExample 4.2 Example: Given a function \\(f(\\mathbf{x})=(x_1-1)^2+x_2^2+1\\), find the (1) Gradient and (2) Critical point of \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\).\n\n\nSolution 4.1.

For functions of \\(n\\) variables, we use second order partial derivatives as an indicator of curvature.\n\nDefinition 4.7 (Hessian) Given a function \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\) in \\(n\\) variables, the hessian \\(\\mathbf{H(x)}\\) is an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix, where the \\((i,j)\\)th element is the second order partial derivative of \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\) with respect to \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_j\\):\n\\[\\mathbf{H(x)}=\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_1^2}&\\frac{\\partial^2f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_2}& \\cdots & \\frac{\\partial^2 f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_1 \\partial x_n} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_2 \\partial x_1}&\\frac{\\partial^2f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_2^2}&\n\\cdots & \\frac{\\partial^2 f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_2 \\partial x_n}\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_n \\partial x_1}&\\frac{\\partial^2f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_n \\partial x_2}&\n\\cdots & \\frac{\\partial^2 f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_n^2}\\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nNote that the hessian will be a symmetric matrix because \\(\\frac{\\partial f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_1\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial f(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial x_2\\partial x_1}\\).\nAlso note that given that \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\) is of quadratic form, each element of the hessian will be a constant.\nThese definitions will be employed when we determine the Second Order Conditions of a function:\nGiven a function \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\) and a point \\(\\mathbf{x}^*\\) such that \\(\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}^*)=0\\),\n\nHessian is Positive Definite \\(\\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\\) Strict Local Min\nHessian is Positive Semidefinite \\(\\forall \\mathbf{x}\\in B(\\mathbf{x}^*,\\epsilon)\\)} \\(\\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\\) Local Min\nHessian is Negative Definite \\(\\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\\) Strict Local Max\nHessian is Negative Semidefinite \\(\\forall \\mathbf{x}\\in B(\\mathbf{x}^*,\\epsilon)\\)} \\(\\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\\) Local Max\nHessian is Indefinite \\(\\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad\\) Saddle Point\n\n\nExample 4.3 (Max and min with two dimensions) We found that the only critical point of \\(f(\\mathbf{x})=(x_1-1)^2+x_2^2+1\\) is at \\(\\mathbf{x}^*=(1,0)\\). Is it a min, max, or saddle point?\n\n\nSolution 4.2. The Hessian is \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{H(x)} &= \\begin{pmatrix} 2&0\\\\0&2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\\] The Leading principal minors of the Hessian are \\(M_1=2; M_2=4\\). Now we consider Definiteness. Since both leading principal minors are positive, the Hessian is positive definite.\nMaxima, Minima, or Saddle Point? Since the Hessian is positive definite and the gradient equals 0, \\(x^\\star = (1,0)\\) is a strict local minimum.\nNote: Alternate check of definiteness.

    "section": "4.5 Constrained Optimization",
    "text": "4.5 Constrained Optimization\nWe have already looked at optimizing a function in one or more dimensions over the whole domain of the function. Often, however, we want to find the maximum or minimum of a function over some restricted part of its domain.\nex: Maximizing utility subject to a budget constraint\n\n\n\nA typical Utility Function with a Budget Constraint\n\n\nTypes of Constraints: For a function \\(f(x_1, \\dots, x_n)\\), there are two types of constraints that can be imposed:\nIn any constrained optimization problem, the constrained maximum will always be less than or equal to the unconstrained maximum. If the constrained maximum is less than the unconstrained maximum, then the constraint is binding. Essentially, this means that you can treat your constraint as an equality constraint rather than an inequality constraint.\nFor example, the budget constraint binds when you spend your entire budget. This generally happens because we believe that utility is strictly increasing in consumption, i.e. you always want more so you spend everything you have.\nAny number of constraints can be placed on an optimization problem. When working with multiple constraints, always make sure that the set of constraints are not pathological; it must be possible for all of the constraints to be satisfied simultaneously.\n\n\\[\\max_{x_1,x_2} f(x_1,x_2) \\text{ s.t. } c(x_1,x_2)\\] \\[\\min_{x_1,x_2} f(x_1,x_2) \\text{ s.t. } c(x_1,x_2)\\]\nThis tells us to maximize/minimize our function, \\(f(x_1,x_2)\\), with respect to the choice variables, \\(x_1,x_2\\), subject to the constraint.\nExample:\n\\[\\max_{x_1,x_2} f(x_1, x_2) = -(x_1^2 + 2x_2^2) \\text{ s.t. }x_1 + x_2 = 4\\]\nIt is easy to see that the maximum occurs at \\((x_1, x_2) = (0,0)\\), but that does not satisfy the constraint. How should we proceed?\n\nEquality Constraints\nEquality constraints are the easiest to deal with because we know that the maximum or minimum has to lie on the (intersection of the) constraint(s).\nThe trick is to change the problem from a constrained optimization problem in \\(n\\) variables to an unconstrained optimization problem in \\(n + k\\) variables, adding one variable for each equality constraint. We do this using a lagrangian multiplier.\nLagrangian function: The Lagrangian function allows us to combine the function we want to optimize and the constraint function into a single function. Once we have this single function, we can proceed as if this were an unconstrained optimization problem.\nFor each constraint, we must include a Lagrange multiplier (\\(\\lambda_i\\)) as an additional variable in the analysis. These terms are the link between the constraint and the Lagrangian function.\nGiven a two dimensional set-up: \\[\\max_{x_1,x_2}/\\min_{x_1,x_2} f(x_1,x_2) \\text{ s.t. } c(x_1,x_2) = a\\]\nWe define the Lagrangian function \\(L(x_1,x_2,\\lambda_1)\\) as follows: \\[L(x_1,x_2,\\lambda_1) = f(x_1,x_2) - \\lambda_1 (c(x_1,x_2) - a)\\]\nMore generally, in n dimensions: \\[ L(x_1, \\dots, x_n, \\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k) = f(x_1, \\dots, x_n) - \\sum_{i=1}^k\\lambda_i(c_i(x_1,\\dots, x_n) - r_i)\\]\nGetting the sign right: Note that above we subtract the lagrangian term and we subtract the constraint constant from the constraint function. Occasionally, you may see the following alternative form of the Lagrangian, which is equivalent: \\[ L(x_1, \\dots, x_n, \\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k) = f(x_1, \\dots, x_n) + \\sum_{i=1}^k\\lambda_i(r_i - c_i(x_1,\\dots, x_n))\\] Here we add the lagrangian term and we subtract the constraining function from the constraint constant.\nUsing the Lagrangian to Find the Critical Points: To find the critical points, we take the partial derivatives of lagrangian function, \\(L(x_1, \\dots, x_n, \\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k)\\), with respect to each of its variables (all choice variables \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and all lagrangian multipliers \\(\\mathbf{\\lambda}\\)). At a critical point, each of these partial derivatives must be equal to zero, so we obtain a system of \\(n + k\\) equations in \\(n + k\\) unknowns:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_1} &= \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1} - \\sum_{i = 1}^k\\lambda_i\\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial x_1} = 0\\\\\n\\vdots &= \\vdots \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_n}  &= \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n} - \\sum_{i = 1}^k\\lambda_i\\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial x_n} = 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda_1} &= c_1(x_i, \\dots, x_n) - r_1 =  0\\\\\n\\vdots &= \\vdots \\nonumber \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda_k} &= c_k(x_i, \\dots, x_n) - r_k = 0\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe can then solve this system of equations, because there are \\(n+k\\) equations and \\(n+k\\) unknowns, to calculate the critical point \\((x_1^*,\\dots,x_n^*,\\lambda_1^*,\\dots,\\lambda_k^*)\\).\nSecond-order Conditions and Unconstrained Optimization: There may be more than one critical point, i.e. we need to verify that the critical point we find is a maximum/minimum. Similar to unconstrained optimization, we can do this by checking the second-order conditions.\n\nExample 4.4 (Constrained optimization with two goods and a budget constraint) Find the constrained optimization of \\[\\max_{x_1,x_2} f(x) = -(x_1^2 + 2x_2^2) \\text{ s.t. } x_1 + x_2 = 4\\]\n\n\nSolution 4.3. \n\nBegin by writing the Lagrangian: \\[L(x_1, x_2, \\lambda) =  -(x_1^2 + 2x_2^2) - \\lambda(x_1 + x_2 - 4)\\]\nTake the partial derivatives and set equal to zero:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_1} = -2x_1 - \\lambda \\quad \\quad \\quad &= 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_2}  = -4x_2 - \\lambda \\quad \\quad \\quad &= 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda} = -(x_1 + x_2 - 4) \\quad & = & 0\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nSolve the system of equations: Using the first two partials, we see that \\(\\lambda = -2x_1\\) and \\(\\lambda = -4x_2\\) Set these equal to see that \\(x_1 = 2x_2\\). Using the third partial and the above equality, \\(4 = 2x_2 + x_2\\) from which we get \\[x_2^* = 4/3, x_1^* = 8/3, \\lambda = -16/3\\]\nTherefore, the only critical point is \\(x_1^* = \\frac{8}{3}\\) and \\(x_2^* = \\frac{4}{3}\\)\nThis gives \\(f(\\frac{8}{3}, \\frac{4}{3}) = -\\frac{96}{9}\\), which is less than the unconstrained optimum \\(f(0,0) = 0\\)\n\n\nNotice that when we take the partial derivative of L with respect to the Lagrangian multiplier and set it equal to 0, we return exactly our constraint! This is why signs matter.",

This makes inequality constraints more challenging because we do not know if the maximum/minimum lies along one of the constraints (the constraint binds) or in the interior of the region.\nWe must introduce more variables in order to turn the problem into an unconstrained optimization.\nSlack: For each inequality constraint \\(c_i(x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\leq a_i\\), we define a slack variable \\(s_i^2\\) for which the expression \\(c_i(x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\leq a_i - s_i^2\\) would hold with equality. These slack variables capture how close the constraint comes to binding. We use \\(s^2\\) rather than \\(s\\) to ensure that the slack is positive.\nSlack is just a way to transform our constraints.\nGiven a two-dimensional set-up and these edited constraints: \\[\\max_{x_1,x_2}/\\min_{x_1,x_2} f(x_1,x_2) \\text{ s.t. } c(x_1,x_2) \\le a_1\\]\nAdding in Slack: \\[\\max_{x_1,x_2}/\\min_{x_1,x_2} f(x_1,x_2) \\text{ s.t. } c(x_1,x_2) \\le a_1 - s_1^2\\]\nWe define the Lagrangian function \\(L(x_1,x_2,\\lambda_1,s_1)\\) as follows: \\[L(x_1,x_2,\\lambda_1,s_1) = f(x_1,x_2) - \\lambda_1 ( c(x_1,x_2) + s_1^2 - a_1)\\]\nMore generally, in n dimensions: \\[ L(x_1, \\dots, x_n, \\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k, s_1, \\dots, s_k) = f(x_1, \\dots, x_n) - \\sum_{i = 1}^k \\lambda_i(c_i(x_1,\\dots, x_n) + s_i^2 - a_i)\\]\nFinding the Critical Points: To find the critical points, we take the partial derivatives of the lagrangian function, \\(L(x_1,\\dots,x_n,\\lambda_1,\\dots,\\lambda_k,s_1,\\dots,s_k)\\), with respect to each of its variables (all choice variables \\(x\\), all lagrangian multipliers \\(\\lambda\\), and all slack variables \\(s\\)). At a critical point, each of these partial derivatives must be equal to zero, so we obtain a system of \\(n + 2k\\) equations in \\(n + 2k\\) unknowns:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_1} &= \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1} - \\sum_{i = 1}^k\\lambda_i\\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial x_1} = 0\\\\\n\\vdots & =  \\vdots  \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_n}  &= \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n} - \\sum_{i = 1}^k\\lambda_i\\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial x_n} = 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda_1} &= c_1(x_i, \\dots, x_n) + s_1^2 - b_1 = 0\\\\\n\\vdots & = \\vdots \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda_k} &= c_k(x_i, \\dots, x_n) + s_k^2 - b_k = 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial s_1} &= 2s_1\\lambda_1 = 0\\\\\n\\vdots =\\vdots \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial s_k} &= 2s_k\\lambda_k = 0\n\\end{align*}\\]\nComplementary slackness conditions: The last set of first order conditions of the form \\(2s_i\\lambda_i = 0\\) (the partials taken with respect to the slack variables) are known as complementary slackness conditions. These conditions can be satisfied one of three ways:\n\n\\(\\lambda_i = 0\\) and \\(s_i \\neq 0\\): This implies that the slack is positive and thus the constraint does not bind.\n\\(\\lambda_i \\neq 0\\) and \\(s_i = 0\\): This implies that there is no slack in the constraint and the constraint does bind.\n\\(\\lambda_i = 0\\) and \\(s_i = 0\\): In this case, there is no slack but the constraint binds trivially, without changing the optimum.\n\nExample: Find the critical points for the following constrained optimization:\n\\[\\max_{x_1,x_2} f(x) = -(x_1^2 + 2x_2^2) \\text{ s.t. } x_1 + x_2 \\le 4\\]\n\nRewrite with the slack variables:\n\n\\[\\max_{x_1,x_2} f(x) = -(x_1^2 + 2x_2^2) \\text{ s.t. } x_1 + x_2 \\le 4 - s_1^2\\]\n\nWrite the Lagrangian:\n\n\\[L(x_1,x_2,\\lambda_1,s_1) = -(x_1^2 + 2x_2^2) - \\lambda_1 (x_1 + x_2 + s_1^2 - 4)\\]\n\nTake the partial derivatives and set equal to 0:\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_1} = -2x_1 - \\lambda_1  &= 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_2}  = -4x_2 - \\lambda_1 &=  0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda_1} = -(x_1 + x_2 + s_1^2 - 4)&= 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial s_1} = -2s_1\\lambda_1 &= 0\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nConsider all ways that the complementary slackness conditions are solved:\n\nThis shows that there are two critical points: \\((0,0)\\) and \\((\\frac{8}{3},\\frac{4}{3})\\).\n\nFind maximum: Looking at the values of \\(f(x_1,x_2)\\) at the critical points, we see that \\(f(x_1,x_2)\\) is maximized at \\(x_1^* = 0\\) and \\(x_2^*=0\\).\n\n\nExercise 4.3 Example: Find the critical points for the following constrained optimization: \\[\\max_{x_1,x_2} f(x) = -(x_1^2 + 2x_2^2) \\text{ s.t. }\n\\begin{array}{l}\nx_1 + x_2 \\le 4\\\\\nx_1 \\ge 0\\\\\nx_2 \\ge 0\n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\nRewrite with the slack variables:\n\n\nWrite the Lagrangian:\n\n\\[L(x_1, x_2, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3, s_1, s_2, s_3) =  -(x_1^2 + 2x_2^2) - \\lambda_1(x_1 + x_2 + s_1^2  - 4) - \\lambda_2(-x_1 + s_2^2) - \\lambda_3(-x_2 + s_3^2)\\] 3.

    "text": "4.7 Kuhn-Tucker Conditions\nAs you can see, this can be a pain. When dealing explicitly with non-negativity constraints, this process is simplified by using the Kuhn-Tucker method.\nBecause the problem of maximizing a function subject to inequality and non-negativity constraints arises frequently in economics, the Kuhn-Tucker conditions provides a method that often makes it easier to both calculate the critical points and identify points that are (local) maxima.\nGiven a two-dimensional set-up: \\[\\max_{x_1,x_2}/\\min_{x_1,x_2} f(x_1,x_2) \\text{ s.t. }\n\\begin{array}{l}\nc(x_1,x_2) \\le a_1\\\\\nx_1 \\ge 0 \\\\\ngx_2 \\ge 0\n\\end{array}\\]\nWe define the Lagrangian function \\(L(x_1,x_2,\\lambda_1)\\) the same as if we did not have the non-negativity constraints: \\[L(x_1,x_2,\\lambda_2) = f(x_1,x_2) - \\lambda_1(c(x_1,x_2) - a_1)\\]\nMore generally, in n dimensions: \\[ L(x_1, \\dots, x_n, \\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k) = f(x_1, \\dots, x_n) - \\sum_{i=1}^k\\lambda_i(c_i(x_1,\\dots, x_n) - a_i)\\]\nKuhn-Tucker and Complementary Slackness Conditions: To find the critical points, we first calculate the Kuhn-Tucker conditions by taking the partial derivatives of the lagrangian function, \\(L(x_1,\\dots,x_n,\\lambda_1,\\dots,\\lambda_k)\\), with respect to each of its variables (all choice variable s\\(x\\) and all lagrangian multipliers \\(\\lambda\\)) and we calculate the complementary slackness conditions by multiplying each partial derivative by its respective variable and include non-negativity conditions for all variables (choice variables \\(x\\) and lagrangian multipliers \\(\\lambda\\)).\nKuhn-Tucker Conditions\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_1} \\leq 0, & \\dots, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_n} \\leq 0\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda_1} \\geq 0, & \\dots, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda_m} \\geq 0\n\\end{align*}\\]\nComplementary Slackness Conditions\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nx_1\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_1} = 0, & \\dots, x_n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_n} = 0\\\\\n\\lambda_1\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda_1} = 0, & \\dots, \\lambda_m \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda_m} = 0\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNon-negativity Conditions \\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nx_1 \\geq 0 & \\dots & x_n \\geq 0\\\\\n\\lambda_1 \\geq 0 & \\dots & \\lambda_m \\geq 0\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nNote that some of these conditions are set equal to 0, while others are set as inequalities!\nNote also that to minimize the function \\(f(x_1, \\dots, x_n)\\), the simplest thing to do is maximize the function \\(-f(x_1, \\dots, x_n)\\); all of the conditions remain the same after reformulating as a maximization problem.\nThere are additional assumptions (notably, f(x) is quasi-concave and the constraints are convex) that are sufficient to ensure that a point satisfying the Kuhn-Tucker conditions is a global max; if these assumptions do not hold, you may have to check more than one point.\nFinding the Critical Points with Kuhn-Tucker Conditions: Given the above conditions, to find the critical points we solve the above system of equations.

    "text": "5.1 Counting rules\nProbability in high school is usually really about combinatorics: the probability of event A is the number of ways in which A can occur divided by the number of all other possibilities. This is a very simplified version of probability, which we can call the “counting definition of probability”, essentially because each possible event to count is often equally likely and discrete. But it is still good to review the underlying rules here.\nFundamental Theorem of Counting: If an object has \\(j\\) different characteristics that are independent of each other, and each characteristic \\(i\\) has \\(n_i\\) ways of being expressed, then there are \\(\\prod_{i = 1}^j n_i\\) possible unique objects.\nWe often need to count the number of ways to choose a subset from some set of possibilities. The number of outcomes depends on two characteristics of the process: does the order matter and is replacement allowed?\nIt is useful to think of any problem concretely, e.g. through a sampling table: If there are \\(n\\) objects which are numbered 1 to \\(n\\) and we select \\(k &lt; n\\) of them, how many different outcomes are possible?\nIf the order in which a given object is selected matters, selecting 4 numbered objects in the following order (1, 3, 7, 2) and selecting the same four objects but in a different order such as (7, 2, 1, 3) will be counted as different outcomes.\nIf replacement is allowed, there are always the same \\(n\\) objects to select from. However, if replacement is not allowed, there is always one less option than the previous round when making a selection. For example, if replacement is not allowed and I am selecting 3 elements from the following set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, I will have 6 options at first, 5 options as I make my second selection, and 4 options as I make my third.\nExpression \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is read as “n choose k” and denotes \\(\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}\\).

    "text": "5.2 Sets\nProbability is about quantifying the uncertainty of events. Sets (set theory) are the mathematical way we choose to formalize those events. Events are not inherently numerical: the onset of war or the stock market crashing is not inherently a number. Sets can define such events, and we wrap math around so that we have a transparent language to communicate about those events. Measure theory might sound mysterious or hard, but it is also just a mathematical way to quantify things like length, volume, and mass. Probability can be thought of as a particular application of measure theory where we want to quantify the measure of a set.\nSet : A set is any well defined collection of elements. If \\(x\\) is an element of \\(S\\), \\(x \\in S\\).\nSample Space (S): A set or collection of all possible outcomes from some process. Outcomes in the set can be discrete elements (countable) or points along a continuous interval (uncountable).\nExamples:\n\nDiscrete: the numbers on a die, whether a vote cast is republican or democrat.\nContinuous: GNP, arms spending, age.\n\nEvent: Any collection of possible outcomes of an experiment. Any subset of the full set of possibilities, including the full set itself. Event A \\(\\subset\\) S.\nEmpty Set: a set with no elements. \\(S = \\{\\}\\).

In everyday speech, we say that we are uncertain about the outcome of random events. Probability is a formal model of uncertainty which provides a measure of uncertainty governed by a particular set of rules (Figure Figure 5.1). A different model of uncertainty would, of course, have a set of rules different from anything we discuss here. Our focus on probability is justified because it has proven to be a particularly useful model of uncertainty.\nProbability Distribution Function: a mapping of each event in the sample space \\(S\\) to the real numbers that satisfy the following three axioms (also called Kolmogorov’s Axioms).\nFormally,\n\nDefinition 5.1 (Probability) Probability is a function that maps events to a real number, obeying the axioms of probability.\n\nThe axioms of probability make sure that the separate events add up in terms of probability, and – for standardization purposes – that they add up to 1.\n\nDefinition 5.2 (Axioms of Probability)  \n\nFor any event \\(A\\), \\(P(A)\\ge 0\\).\n\\(P(S)=1\\)\nThe Countable Additivity Axiom: For any sequence of disjoint (mutually exclusive) events \\(A_1,A_2,\\ldots\\) (of which there may be infinitely many), \\[P\\left( \\bigcup\\limits_{i=1}^k\nA_i\\right)=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k P(A_i)\\]\n\nThe last axiom is an extension of a union to infinite sets. When there are only two events in the space, it boils down to:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nP(A_1 \\cup A_2) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) \\quad\\text{for disjoint } A_1, A_2\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nProbability Operations\nUsing these three axioms, we can define all of the common rules of probability.\n\n\\(P(\\emptyset)=0\\)\nFor any event \\(A\\), \\(0\\le P(A) \\le 1\\).\n\\(P({A}^C)=1-P(A)\\)\nIf \\(A\\subset B\\) (\\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\)), then \\(P(A)\\le P(B)\\).\nFor any two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(P(A\\cup\nB)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\\cap B)\\)\nBoole’s Inequality: For any sequence of \\(n\\) events (which need not be disjoint) \\(A_1,A_2,\\ldots,A_n\\), then \\(P\\left( \\bigcup\\limits_{i=1}^n\nA_i\\right) \\leq \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n P(A_i)\\).\n\n\nExample 5.4 (Probability) Assume we have an evenly-balanced, six-sided die.\nThen,\n\nSample space S =\n\\(P(1)=\\cdots=P(6)=\\)\n\\(P(\\emptyset)=P(7)=\\)\n\\(P\\left( \\{ 1, 3, 5 \\} \\right)=\\)\n\\(P\\left( \\{ 1, 2 \\}^C \\right)= P\\left( \\{ 3, 4, 5, 6 \\}\\right)=\\)\nLet \\(A=\\{ 1,2,3,4,5 \\}\\subset S\\).

    "text": "5.4 Conditional Probability and Bayes Rule\nConditional Probability: The conditional probability \\(P(A|B)\\) of an event \\(A\\) is the probability of \\(A\\), given that another event \\(B\\) has occurred. Conditional probability allows for the inclusion of other information into the calculation of the probability of an event. It is calculated as\n\\[P(A|B)=\\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(B)}\\]\nNote that conditional probabilities are probabilities and must also follow the Kolmagorov axioms of probability.\n\nExample 5.5 (Conditional Probability 1) Assume \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occur with the following frequencies: \\(\\quad\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(A\\)\n\\(A^c\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(B\\)\n\\(n_{ab}\\)\n\\(n_{a^cb}\\)\n\n\n\\(B^C\\)\n\\(n_{ab^c}\\)\n\\(n_{(ab)^c}\\)\n\n\n\nand let \\(n_{ab}+n_{a^Cb}+n_{ab^C}+n_{(ab)^C}=N\\).

What is the probability of a 1, given the outcome is an odd number?\n\nYou could rearrange the fraction to highlight how a joint probability could be expressed as the product of a conditional probability.\n\nDefinition 5.3 (Multiplicative Law of Probability) The probability of the intersection of two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(P(A\\cap B)=P(A)P(B|A)=P(B)P(A|B)\\) which follows directly from the definition of conditional probability. More generally,\n\\[P(A_1\\cap \\cdots\\cap A_k) = P(A_k| A_{k-1}\\cap \\cdots \\cap A_1)\\times P(A_{k-1}|A_{k-2}\\cap \\cdots A_1) \\times \\ldots \\times P(A_2|A_1)\\times P(A_1)\\]\nSometimes it is easier to calculate these conditional probabilities and sum them than it is to calculate \\(P(A)\\) directly.\n\n\nDefinition 5.4 (Law of Total Probability) Let \\(S\\) be the sample space of some experiment and let the disjoint \\(k\\) events \\(B_1,\\ldots,B_k\\) partition \\(S\\), such that \\(P(B_1\\cup ... \\cup B_k) = P(S) = 1\\). If \\(A\\) is some other event in \\(S\\), then the events \\(A\\cap B_1, A\\cap B_2, \\ldots, A\\cap B_k\\) will form a partition of \\(A\\) and we can write \\(A\\) as \\[A=(A\\cap B_1)\\cup\\cdots\\cup (A\\cap B_k)\\].\nSince the \\(k\\) events are disjoint,\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\nP(A)&=&\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k P(A \\cap B_i)\\\\\n      &=&\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k P(B_i)P(A|B_i)\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\n\nBayes Rule: Assume that events \\(B_1,\\ldots,B_k\\) form a partition of the space \\(S\\). Then by the Law of Total Probability\n\\[P(B_j|A)= \\frac{P(A \\cap B_j)} {P(A)} = \\frac{P(B_j) P(A|B_j)}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k P(B_i)P(A|B_i)}\\]\nIf there are only two states of \\(B\\), then this is just \\[P(B_1|A)=\\frac{P(B_1)P(A|B_1)} {P(B_1)P(A|B_1)+P(B_2)P(A|B_2)}\\]\nBayes’ rule determines the posterior probability of a state \\(P(B_j|A)\\) by calculating the probability \\(P(A \\cap B_j)\\) that both the event \\(A\\) and the state \\(B_j\\) will occur and dividing it by the probability that the event will occur regardless of the state (by summing across all \\(B_i\\)). The states could be something like Normal/Defective, Healthy/Diseased, Republican/Democrat/Independent, etc. The event on which one conditions could be something like a sampling from a batch of components, a test for a disease, or a question about a policy position.\nPrior and Posterior Probabilities: Above, \\(P(B_1)\\) is often called the prior probability, since it’s the probability of \\(B_1\\) before anything else is known. \\(P(B_1|A)\\) is called the posterior probability, since it’s the probability after other information is taken into account.\n\nExample 5.7 (Bayes’ Rule) In a given town, 40% of the voters are Democrat and 60% are Republican. The president’s budget is supported by 50% of the Democrats and 90% of the Republicans. If a randomly (equally likely) selected voter is found to support the president’s budget, what is the probability that they are a Democrat?\n\n\nExercise 5.4 (Conditional Probability) Assume that 2% of the population of the U.S. are members of some extremist militia group. We develop a survey that positively classifies someone as being a member of a militia group given that they are a member 95% of the time and negatively classifies someone as not being a member of a militia group given that they are not a member 97% of the time. What is the probability that someone positively classified as being a member of a militia group is actually a militia member?",

    "text": "5.5 Independence\n\nDefinition 5.5 (Independence) If the occurrence or nonoccurrence of either events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have no effect on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the other, then \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent.\n\nIf \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent, then\n\n\\(P(A|B)=P(A)\\)\n\\(P(B|A)=P(B)\\)\n\\(P(A\\cap B)=P(A)P(B)\\)\nMore generally than the above, \\(P(\\bigcap_{i=1}^k A_i) = \\prod_{i = 1}^K P(A_i)\\)\n\nAre mutually exclusive events independent of each other?\nNo. If A and B are mutually exclusive, then they cannot happen simultaneously. If we know that A occurred, then we know that B couldn’t have occurred. Because of this, A and B aren’t independent.\nPairwise Independence: A set of more than two events \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_k\\) is pairwise independent if \\(P(A_i\\cap A_j)=P(A_i)P(A_j)\\), \\(\\forall i\\neq j\\). Note that this does not necessarily imply joint independence.\nConditional Independence: If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent once you know the occurrence of a third event \\(C\\), then \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are conditionally independent (conditional on \\(C\\)):\n\n\\(P(A|B \\cap C)=P(A|C)\\)\n\\(P(B|A \\cap C)=P(B|C)\\)\n\\(P(A\\cap B|C)=P(A|C)P(B|C)\\)\n\nJust because two events are conditionally independent does not mean that they are independent. Actually it is hard to think of real-world things that are “unconditionally” independent. That’s why it’s always important to ask about a finding: What was it conditioned on? For example, suppose that a graduate school admission decisions are done by only one professor, who picks a group of 50 bright students and flips a coin for each student to generate a class of about 25 students. Then the the probability that two students get accepted are conditionally independent, because they are determined by two separate coin tosses. However, this does not mean that their admittance is not completely independent. Knowing that student \\(A\\) got in gives us information about whether student \\(B\\) got in, if we think that the professor originally picked her pool of 50 students by merit.\nPerhaps more counter-intuitively: If two events are already independent, then it might seem that no amount of “conditioning” will make them dependent. But this is not always so. For example2, suppose I only get a call from two people, Alice and Bob. Let \\(A\\) be the event that Alice calls, and \\(B\\) be the event that Bob calls. Alice and Bob do not communicate, so \\(P(A \\mid B) = P(A).\\) But now let \\(C\\) be the event that your phone rings. For conditional independence to hold here, then \\(P(A \\mid C)\\) must be equal to \\(P(A \\mid B \\cap C).\\) But this is not true – \\(A \\mid C\\) may or may not be true, but \\(P(A \\mid B \\cap C)\\) certainly is true.",

    "text": "5.6 Random Variables\nMost questions in the social sciences involve events, rather than numbers per se. To analyze and reason about events quantitatively, we need a way of mapping events to numbers. A random variable does exactly that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: The Random Variable as a Real-Valued Function\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 5.6 (Random Variable) A random variable is a measurable function \\(X\\) that maps from the sample space \\(S\\) to the set of real numbers \\(R.\\) It assigns a real number to every outcome \\(s \\in S\\).\n\nFigure Figure 5.2 shows a image of the function. It might seem strange to define a random variable as a function – which is neither random nor variable. The randomness comes from the realization of an event from the sample space \\(s\\).\nRandomness means that the outcome of some experiment is not deterministic, i.e. there is some probability (\\(0 &lt; P(A) &lt; 1\\)) that the event will occur.\nThe support of a random variable is all values for which there is a positive probability of occurrence.\nExample: Flip a fair coin two times. What is the sample space?\nA random variable must map events to the real line. For example, let a random variable \\(X\\) be the number of heads. The event \\((H, H)\\) gets mapped to 2 \\(X(s) = 2\\), and the events \\(\\{(H, T), (T, H)\\}\\) gets mapped to 1 \\((X(s) = 1)\\), the event \\((T, T)\\) gets mapped to 0 \\((X(s) = 0)\\).\nWhat are other possible random variables?",

    "section": "5.7 Distributions",
    "text": "5.7 Distributions\nWe now have two main concepts in this section – probability and random variables. Given a sample space \\(S\\) and the same experiment, both probability and random variables take events as their inputs. But they output different things (probabilities measure the “size” of events, random variables give a number in a way that the analyst chose to define the random variable). How do the two concepts relate?\nThe concept of distributions is the natural bridge between these two concepts.\n\nDefinition 5.7 (Distribution of a random variable) A distribution of a random variable is a function that specifies the probabilities of all events associated with that random variable. There are several types of distributions: A probability mass function for a discrete random variable and probability density function for a continuous random variable.\n\nNotice how the definition of distributions combines two ideas of random variables and probabilities of events. First, the distribution considers a random variable, call it \\(X\\). \\(X\\) can take a number of possible numeric values.\n\nExample 5.8 (Total Number of Occurrences) Consider three binary outcomes, one for each patient recovering from a disease: \\(R_i\\) denotes the event in which patient \\(i\\) (\\(i = 1, 2, 3\\)) recovers from a disease. \\(R_1\\), \\(R_2\\), and \\(R_3\\). How would we represent the total number of people who end up recovering from the disease?\n\n\nSolution 5.1. Define the random variable \\(X\\) be the total number of people (out of three) who recover from the disease. Random variables are functions, that take as an input a set of events (in the sample space \\(S\\)) and deterministically assigns them to a number of the analyst’s choice.\n\nRecall that with each of these numerical values there is a class of events. In the previous example, for \\(X = 3\\) there is one outcome (\\(R_1, R_2, R_3\\)) and for \\(X = 1\\) there are multiple (\\(\\{(R_1, R_2^c, R_3^c), (R_1^c, R_2, R_3^c), (R_1^c, R_2^c, R_3), \\}\\)). Now, the thing to notice here is that each of these events naturally come with a probability associated with them. That is, \\(P(R_1, R_2, R_3)\\) is a number from 0 to 1, as is \\(P(R_1, R_2^c, R_3^c)\\). These all have probabilities because they are in the sample space \\(S\\). The function that tells us these probabilities that are associated with a numerical value of a random variable is called a distribution.\nIn other words, a random variable \\(X\\) induces a probability distribution \\(P\\) (sometimes written \\(P_X\\) to emphasize that the probability density is about the r.v. \\(X\\))\n\nDiscrete Random Variables\nThe formal definition of a random variable is easier to given by separating out two cases: discrete random variables when the numeric summaries of the events are discrete, and continuous random variables when they are continuous.\n\nDefinition 5.8 (Discrete Random Variable) \\(X\\) is a discrete random variable if it can assume only a finite or countably infinite number of distinct values. Examples: number of wars per year, heads or tails.\n\nThe distribution of a discrete r.v. is a PMF:\n\nDefinition 5.9 (Probability Mass Function) For a discrete random variable \\(X\\), the probability mass function (Also referred to simply as the “probability distribution.”) (PMF), \\(p(x)=P(X=x)\\), assigns probabilities to a countable number of distinct \\(x\\) values such that\n\n\\(0\\le p(x)\\le 1\\)\n\\(\\sum\\limits_y p(x)=1\\)\n\n\nExample: For a fair six-sided die, there is an equal probability of rolling any number. Since there are six sides, the probability mass function is then \\(p(y)=1/6\\) for \\(y=1,\\ldots,6\\), 0 otherwise.}\nIn a discrete random variable, cumulative density function (Also referred to simply as the “cumulative distribution” or previously as the “density function”), \\(F(x)\\) or \\(P(X\\le x)\\), is the probability that \\(X\\) is less than or equal to some value \\(x\\), or \\[P(X\\le x)=\\sum\\limits_{i\\le x} p(i)\\]\nProperties a CDF must satisfy:\n\n\\(F(x)\\) is non-decreasing in \\(x\\).\n\\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to -\\infty} F(x) = 0\\) and \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} F(x) = 1\\)\n\\(F(x)\\) is right-continuous.\n\nNote that \\(P(X &gt; x) = 1 - P(X \\le x)\\).\n\nExample 5.9 For a fair die with its value as \\(Y\\), What are the following?\n\n\\(P(Y\\le 1)\\)\n\\(P(Y\\le 3)\\)\n\\(P(Y\\le 6)\\)\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Random Variables\nWe also have a similar definition for continuous random variables.\n\nDefinition 5.10 (Continuous Random Variable) \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable if there exists a nonnegative function \\(f(x)\\) defined for all real \\(x\\in (-\\infty,\\infty)\\), such that for any interval \\(A\\), \\(P(X\\in A)=\\int\\limits_A f(x)dx\\). Examples: age, income, GNP, temperature.\n\n\nDefinition 5.11 (Probability Density Function) The function \\(f\\) above is called the probability density function (pdf) of \\(X\\) and must satisfy \\[f(x)\\ge 0\\] \\[\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x)dx=1\\]\nNote also that \\(P(X = x)=0\\) — i.e., the probability of any point \\(y\\) is zero.\n\nFor both discrete and continuous random variables, we have a unifying concept of another measure: the cumulative distribution:\n\nDefinition 5.12 (Cumulative Density Function) Because the probability that a continuous random variable will assume any particular value is zero, we can only make statements about the probability of a continuous random variable being within an interval. The cumulative distribution gives the probability that \\(Y\\) lies on the interval \\((-\\infty,y)\\) and is defined as \\[F(x)=P(X\\le x)=\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^x f(s)ds\\] Note that \\(F(x)\\) has similar properties with continuous distributions as it does with discrete - non-decreasing, continuous (not just right-continuous), and \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to -\\infty} F(x) = 0\\) and \\(\\lim\\limits_{x \\to \\infty} F(x) = 1\\).\n\nWe can also make statements about the probability of \\(Y\\) falling in an interval \\(a\\le y\\le b\\). \\[P(a\\le x\\le b)=\\int\\limits_a^b f(x)dx\\]\nThe PDF and CDF are linked by the integral: The CDF of the integral of the PDF: \\[f(x) = F'(x)=\\frac{dF(x)}{dx}\\]\n\nExample 5.10 For \\(f(y)=1, \\quad 0&lt;y&lt;1\\), find: (1) The CDF \\(F(y)\\) and (2) The probability \\(P(0.5&lt;y&lt;0.75)\\).",

The intuition behind this that Expectation is an integral, which is a type of sum.\n\nExpectation of a constant is a constant \\[E(c)=c\\]\nConstants come out \\[E(c g(Y))= c E(g(Y))\\]\nExpectation is Linear \\[E(g(Y_1) + \\cdots + g(Y_n))=E(g(Y_1)) +\\cdots+E(g(Y_n)),\\] regardless of independence\nExpected Value of Expected Values: \\[E(E(Y)) = E(Y)\\] (because the expected value of a random variable is a constant)\n\nFinally, if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, even products are easy:\n\\[E(XY) = E(X)E(Y)\\]\nConditional Expectation: With joint distributions, we are often interested in the expected value of a variable \\(Y\\) if we could hold the other variable \\(X\\) fixed. This is the conditional expectation of \\(Y\\) given \\(X = x\\):\n\n\\(Y\\) discrete: \\(E(Y|X = x) = \\sum_y yp_{Y|X}(y|x)\\)\n\\(Y\\) continuous: \\(E(Y|X = x) = \\int_y yf_{Y|X}(y|x)dy\\)\n\nThe conditional expectation is often used for prediction when one knows the value of \\(X\\) but not \\(Y\\)",

We don’t observe random variables; we observe realizations of the random variable.

    "section": "5.13 Asymptotic Theory",
    "text": "5.13 Asymptotic Theory\nIn theoretical and applied research, asymptotic arguments are often made. In this section we briefly introduce some of this material.\nWhat are asymptotics? In probability theory, asymptotic analysis is the study of limiting behavior. By limiting behavior, we mean the behavior of some random process as the number of observations gets larger and larger.\nWhy is this important? We rarely know the true process governing the events we see in the social world. It is helpful to understand how such unknown processes theoretically must behave and asymptotic theory helps us do this.\n\n5.13.1 CLT and LLN\nWe are now finally ready to revisit, with a bit more precise terms, the two pillars of statistical theory we motivated Section Section 2.3 with.\n\nTheorem 5.1 (Central Limit Theorem (i.i.d. case)) Let \\(\\{X_n\\} = \\{X_1, X_2, \\ldots\\}\\) be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with finite mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)). Then, the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}_n = \\frac{X_1 + X_2 + \\cdots + X_n}{n}\\) increasingly converges into a Normal distribution.\n\\[\\frac{\\bar{X}_n - \\mu}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}} \\xrightarrow{d} \\text{Normal}(0, 1),\\]\n\nAnother way to write this as a probability statement is that for all real numbers \\(a\\),\n\\[P\\left(\\frac{\\bar{X}_n - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} \\le a\\right) \\rightarrow \\Phi(a)\\] as \\(n\\to \\infty\\), where \\[\\Phi(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}} \\, dx\\] is the CDF of a Normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.\nThis result means that, as \\(n\\) grows, the distribution of the sample mean \\(\\bar X_n = \\frac{1}{n} (X_1 + X_2 + \\cdots + X_n)\\) is approximately normal with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt n}\\), i.e., \\[\\bar{X}_n \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\bigg(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\bigg).\\] The standard deviation of \\(\\bar X_n\\) (which is roughly a measure of the precision of \\(\\bar X_n\\) as an estimator of \\(\\mu\\)) decreases at the rate \\(1/\\sqrt{n}\\), so, for example, to increase its precision by \\(10\\) (i.e., to get one more digit right), one needs to collect \\(10^2=100\\) times more units of data.\nIntuitively, this result also justifies that whenever a lot of small, independent processes somehow combine together to form the realized observations, practitioners often feel comfortable assuming Normality.\n\nTheorem 5.2 (Law of Large Numbers (LLN)) For any draw of independent random variables with the same mean \\(\\mu\\), the sample average after \\(n\\) draws, \\(\\bar{X}_n = \\frac{1}{n}(X_1 + X_2 + \\ldots + X_n)\\), converges in probability to the expected value of \\(X\\), \\(\\mu\\) as \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\):\n\\[\\lim\\limits_{n\\to \\infty} P(|\\bar{X}_n - \\mu | &gt; \\varepsilon) = 0\\]\nA shorthand of which is \\(\\bar{X}_n \\xrightarrow{p} \\mu\\), where the arrow is read as “converges in probability to”.\n\nas \\(n\\to \\infty\\). In other words, \\(P( \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\bar{X}_n = \\mu) = 1\\). This is an important motivation for the widespread use of the sample mean, as well as the intuition link between averages and expected values.\nMore precisely this version of the LLN is called the weak law of large numbers because it leaves open the possibility that \\(|\\bar{X}_n - \\mu | &gt; \\varepsilon\\) occurs many times. The strong law of large numbers states that, under a few more conditions, the probability that the limit of the sample average is the true mean is 1 (and other possibilities occur with probability 0), but the difference is rarely consequential in practice.\nThe Strong Law of Large Numbers holds so long as the expected value exists; no other assumptions are needed. However, the rate of convergence will differ greatly depending on the distribution underlying the observed data. When extreme observations occur often (i.e. kurtosis is large), the rate of convergence is much slower. Cf. The distribution of financial returns.\n\n\n5.13.2 Big \\(\\mathcal{O}\\) Notation\nSome of you may encounter “big-OH’’-notation. If \\(f, g\\) are two functions, we say that \\(f = \\mathcal{O}(g)\\) if there exists some constant, \\(c\\), such that \\(f(n) \\leq c \\times g(n)\\) for large enough \\(n\\). This notation is useful for simplifying complex problems in game theory, computer science, and statistics.\nExample.\nWhat is \\(\\mathcal{O}( 5\\exp(0.5 n) + n^2 + n / 2)\\)? Answer: \\(\\exp(n)\\). Why? Because, for large \\(n\\), \\[\\frac{ 5\\exp(0.5 n) + n^2 + n / 2 }{ \\exp(n)} \\leq \\frac{ c \\exp(n) }{ \\exp(n)} = c. \\] whenever \\(n &gt; 4\\) and where \\(c = 1\\).",

These numbers can be represented as either a row vector or a column vector: \\[ {\\bf v} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 & v_2 & \\dots & v_n\\end{pmatrix} , {\\bf v} = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_n \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nWe can also think of a vector as defining a point in \\(n\\)-dimensional space, usually \\({\\bf R}^n\\); each element of the vector defines the coordinate of the point in a particular direction.\nVector Addition and Subtraction: If two vectors, \\({\\bf u}\\) and \\({\\bf v}\\), have the same length (i.e. have the same number of elements), they can be added (subtracted) together: \\[ {\\bf u} + {\\bf v} = \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 + v_1 & u_2 + v_2 & \\cdots & u_k + v_n \\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[ {\\bf u} - {\\bf v} = \\begin{pmatrix} u_1 - v_1 & u_2 - v_2 & \\cdots & u_k - v_n \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nScalar Multiplication: The product of a scalar \\(c\\) (i.e. a constant) and vector \\({\\bf v}\\) is:\n\\[ c{\\bf v} =  \\begin{pmatrix} cv_1 & cv_2 & \\dots & cv_n \\end{pmatrix} \\]\nVector Inner Product: The inner product (also called the dot product or scalar product) of two vectors \\({\\bf u}\\) and \\({\\bf v}\\) is again defined if and only if they have the same number of elements \\[ {\\bf u} \\cdot {\\bf v} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + \\cdots + u_nv_n = \\sum_{i = 1}^n u_iv_i\\] If \\({\\bf u} \\cdot {\\bf v} = 0\\), the two vectors are orthogonal (or perpendicular).\nVector Norm: The norm of a vector is a measure of its length. There are many different ways to calculate the norm, but the most common is the Euclidean norm (which corresponds to our usual conception of distance in three-dimensional space): \\[ ||{\\bf v}|| = \\sqrt{{\\bf v}\\cdot{\\bf v}} = \\sqrt{ v_1v_1 + v_2v_2 + \\cdots + v_nv_n}\\]",

The dimensionality of the matrix is defined as the number of rows by the number of columns, \\(m \\times n\\).\n\\[{\\bf A}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n            a_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1n} \\\\\n            a_{21} & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2n} \\\\\n            \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n            a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\cdots & a_{mn}\n        \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nNote that you can think of vectors as special cases of matrices; a column vector of length \\(k\\) is a \\(k \\times 1\\) matrix, while a row vector of the same length is a \\(1 \\times k\\) matrix.\nIt’s also useful to think of matrices as being made up of a collection of row or column vectors. For example, \\[\\bf A = \\begin{pmatrix} {\\bf a}_1 & {\\bf a}_2 &  \\cdots & {\\bf a}_m \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nMatrix Addition: Let \\(\\bf A\\) and \\(\\bf B\\) be two \\(m\\times n\\) matrices. \\[{\\bf A+B}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n            a_{11}+b_{11} & a_{12}+b_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1n}+b_{1n} \\\\\n            a_{21}+b_{21} & a_{22}+b_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2n}+b_{2n} \\\\\n            \\vdots & \\vdots  & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n            a_{m1}+b_{m1} & a_{m2}+b_{m2} & \\cdots & a_{mn}+b_{mn}\n        \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nNote that matrices \\({\\bf A}\\) and \\({\\bf B}\\) must have the same dimensionality, in which case they are conformable for addition.\n\nExample 6.3 \\[{\\bf A}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad\n            {\\bf B}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\] \\({\\bf A+B}=\\)\n\nScalar Multiplication: Given the scalar \\(s\\), the scalar multiplication of \\(s {\\bf A}\\) is \\[ s {\\bf A}=  s \\begin{pmatrix}\n            a_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1n} \\\\\n            a_{21} & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2n} \\\\\n            \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n            a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\cdots & a_{mn}\n        \\end{pmatrix}\n        = \\begin{pmatrix}\n            s a_{11} & s a_{12} & \\cdots & s a_{1n} \\\\\n            s a_{21} & s a_{22} & \\cdots & s a_{2n} \\\\\n            \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n            s a_{m1} & s a_{m2} & \\cdots & s a_{mn}\n        \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nExample 6.4 \\(s=2, \\qquad {\\bf A}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\\(s {\\bf A} =\\)\n\nMatrix Multiplication: If \\({\\bf A}\\) is an \\(m\\times k\\) matrix and \\(\\bf B\\) is a \\(k\\times n\\) matrix, then their product \\(\\bf C = A B\\) is the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix where \\[c_{ij}=a_{i1}b_{1j}+a_{i2}b_{2j}+\\cdots+a_{ik}b_{kj}\\]\n\nExample 6.5  \n\n\\(\\begin{pmatrix} a&b\\\\c&d\\\\e&f \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} A&B\\\\C&D \\end{pmatrix}\n        =\\)\n\\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1&2&-1\\\\3&1&4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -2&5\\\\4&-3\\\\2&1\\end{pmatrix} =\\)\n\n\nNote that the number of columns of the first matrix must equal the number of rows of the second matrix, in which case they are conformable for multiplication. The sizes of the matrices (including the resulting product) must be \\[(m\\times k)(k\\times n)=(m\\times n)\\]\nAlso note that if AB exists, BA exists only if \\(\\dim({\\bf A}) = m \\times n\\) and \\(\\dim({\\bf B}) = n \\times m\\).\nThis does not mean that AB = BA. AB = BA is true only in special circumstances, like when \\({\\bf A}\\) or \\({\\bf B}\\) is an identity matrix or \\({\\bf A} = {\\bf B}^{-1}\\).\nLaws of Matrix Algebra:\nCommutative law for multiplication does not hold – the order of multiplication matters: \\[\\bf AB\\ne BA\\]\nFor example, \\[{\\bf A}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1&2\\\\-1&3\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad {\\bf B}=\\begin{pmatrix} 2&1\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[{\\bf AB}=\\begin{pmatrix} 2&3\\\\-2&2\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad {\\bf BA}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1&7\\\\-1&3\\end{pmatrix}\\]\nTranspose: The transpose of the \\(m\\times n\\) matrix \\(\\bf A\\) is the \\(n\\times m\\) matrix \\({\\bf A}^T\\) (also written \\({\\bf A}'\\)) obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of \\(\\bf A\\).\nFor example,\n\\({\\bf A}=\\begin{pmatrix} 4&-2&3\\\\0&5&-1\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad {\\bf A}^T=\\begin{pmatrix} 4&0\\\\-2&5\\\\3&-1 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\\({\\bf B}=\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\-1\\\\3 \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad {\\bf B}^T=\\begin{pmatrix} 2&-1&3\\end{pmatrix}\\)\nThe following rules apply for transposed matrices:\nExample of \\(({\\bf AB})^T = {\\bf B}^T{\\bf A}^T\\): \\[{\\bf A}=\\begin{pmatrix} 1&3&2\\\\2&-1&3\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad {\\bf B}=\\begin{pmatrix} 0&1\\\\2&2\\\\3&-1\\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[ ({\\bf AB})^T = \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 1&3&2\\\\2&-1&3\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0&1\\\\2&2\\\\3&-1\\end{pmatrix} \\right]^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 12&7\\\\5&-3 \\end{pmatrix}\\] \\[ {\\bf B}^T{\\bf A}^T= \\begin{pmatrix} 0&2&3\\\\1&2&-1 \\end{pmatrix}  \\begin{pmatrix} 1&2\\\\3&-1\\\\2&3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 12&7\\\\5&-3 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nExercise 6.3 (Matrix Multiplication) Let \\[A =  \\begin{pmatrix} 2&0&-1&1\\\\1&2&0&1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\\[B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1&5&-7\\\\1&1&0\\\\0&-1&1\\\\2&0&0\\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\\[C =  \\begin{pmatrix} 3&2&-1\\\\0&4&6 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nCalculate the following:\n\n\\[AB\\]\n\\[BA\\]\n\\[(BC)^T\\]\n\\[BC^T\\]",

An augmented matrix of the form\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix}\n            \\fbox{$a'_{11}$}& a'_{12} & a'_{13}& \\cdots & a'_{1n} & | & b'_1\\\\\n            0 & \\fbox{$a'_{22}$} & a'_{23}& \\cdots & a'_{2n} & | & b'_2\\\\\n            0 & 0 & \\fbox{$a'_{33}$}& \\cdots & a'_{3n} & | & b'_3\\\\\n            0 & 0 &0 & \\ddots & \\vdots  & | & \\vdots \\\\\n            0 & 0 &0 &0 & \\fbox{$a'_{mn}$} & | & b'_m\n            \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nis said to be in row echelon form — each row has more leading zeros than the row preceding it.\nReduced Row Echelon Form: We can go one step further and put the matrix into reduced row echelon form. Reduced row echelon form makes the value of x which solves the system very obvious.

The methods of transforming a matrix or system into row echelon and reduced row echelon form are referred to as Gaussian elimination and Gauss-Jordan elimination, respectively.\nElementary Row Operations: To do Gaussian and Gauss-Jordan elimination, we use three basic operations to transform the augmented matrix into another augmented matrix that represents an equivalent linear system – equivalent in the sense that the same values of \\(x_j\\) solve both the original and transformed matrix/system:\nInterchanging Rows: Suppose we have the augmented matrix \\[{\\widehat{\\bf A}}=\\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & | & b_1\\\\\n            a_{21} & a_{22} & | & b_2\n            \\end{pmatrix}\\] If we interchange the two rows, we get the augmented matrix \\[\\begin{pmatrix}\n            a_{21} & a_{22} & | & b_2\\\\\n            a_{11} & a_{12} & | & b_1\n            \\end{pmatrix}\\] which represents a linear system equivalent to that represented by matrix \\(\\widehat{\\bf A}\\).\nMultiplying by a Constant: If we multiply the second row of matrix \\(\\widehat{\\bf A}\\) by a constant \\(c\\), we get the augmented matrix \\[\\begin{pmatrix}\n            a_{11} & a_{12} & | & b_1\\\\\n            c a_{21} & c a_{22} & | & c b_2\n            \\end{pmatrix}\\] which represents a linear system equivalent to that represented by matrix \\(\\widehat{\\bf A}\\).\nAdding (subtracting) Rows: If we add (subtract) the first row of matrix \\(\\widehat{\\bf A}\\) to the second, we obtain the augmented matrix \\[\\begin{pmatrix}\n            a_{11} & a_{12} & | & b_1\\\\\n            a_{11}+a_{21} & a_{12}+a_{22} & | & b_1+b_2\n            \\end{pmatrix}\\] which represents a linear system equivalent to that represented by matrix \\(\\widehat{\\bf A}\\).\n\nExample 6.6 Solve the following system of equations by using elementary row operations:\n\\(\\begin{matrix}\n            x  & - & 3y & = & -3\\\\\n            2x & + &  y & = &  8\n            \\end{matrix}\\)\n\n\nExercise 6.6 (Solving Systems of Equations) Put the following system of equations into augmented matrix form. Then, using Gaussian or Gauss-Jordan elimination, solve the system of equations by putting the matrix into row echelon or reduced row echelon form.\n\\[\n  1. \\begin{cases}\n               x + y + 2z = 2\\\\\n               3x - 2y + z = 1\\\\\n               y - z = 3\n            \\end{cases}\n               \\]\n\\[\n  2. \\begin{cases}\n               2x + 3y - z = -8\\\\\n               x + 2y - z = 12\\\\\n             -x -4y + z = -6\n            \\end{cases}\n               \\]",

    "text": "7.1 Orienting\n\nWe will be using a cloud version of RStudio at https://rstudio.cloud. You should join the Math Prefresher Space 2019 from the link that was emailed to you. Each day, click on the project with the day’s date on it.\nAlthough most of you will probably doing your work on RStudio local rather than cloud, we are trying to use cloud because it makes it easier to standardize people’s settings.\nRStudio (either cloud or desktop) is a GUI and an IDE for the programming language R. A Graphical User Interface allows users to interface with the software (in this case R) using graphical aids like buttons and tabs. Often we don’t think of GUIs because to most computer users, everything is a GUI (like Microsoft Word or your “Control Panel”), but it’s always there! A Integrated Development Environment just says that the software to interface with R comes with useful useful bells and whistles to give you shortcuts.\n\nThe Console is kind of a the core window through which you see your GUI actually operating through R. It’s not graphical so might not be as intuitive. But all your results, commands, errors, warnings.. you see them in here. A console tells you what’s going on now.\n\n\n\nA Typical RStudio Window at Startup\n\n\n\nvia the GUI, you the analyst needs to sends instructions, or commands, to the R application. The verb for this is “run” or “execute” the command. Computer programs ask users to provide instructions in very specific formats. While a English-speaking human can understand a sentence with a few typos in it by filling in the blanks, the same typo or misplaced character would halt a computer program. Each program has its own requirements for how commands should be typed; after all, each of these is its own language. We refer to the way a program needs its commands to be formatted as its syntax.\nTheoretically, one could do all their work by typing in commands into the Console. But that would be a lot of work, because you’d have to give instructions each time you start your data analysis. Moreover, you’ll have no record of what you did. That’s why you need a script. This is a type of code. It can be referred to as a source because that is the source of your commands. Source is also used as a verb; “source the script” just means execute it. RStudio doesn’t start out with a script, so you can make one from “File &gt; New” or the New file icon.\n\n\n\n\nOpening New Script (as opposed to the Console)\n\n\n\nYou can also open scripts that are in folders in your computer. A script is a type of File. Find your Files in the bottom-right “Files” pane.\nTo load a dataset, you need to specify where that file is. Computer files (data, documents, programs) are organized hierarchically, like a branching tree. Folders can contain files, and also other folders. The GUI toolbar makes this lineaer and hierarchical relationship apparent. When we turn to locate the file in our commands, we need another set of syntax. Importantly, denote the hierarchy of a folder by the / (slash) symbol. data/input/2018-08 indicates the 2018-08 folder, which is included in the input folder, which is in turn included in the data folder.\nFiles (but not folders) have “file extensions” which you are probably familiar with already: .docx, .pdf, and .pdf. The file extensions you will see in a stats or quantitative social science class are:\n\n.pdf: PDF, a convenient format to view documents and slides in, regardless of Mac/Windows.\n.csv: A comma separated values file\n.xlsx: Microsoft Excel file\n.dta: Stata data\n.sav: SPSS data\n.R: R code (script)\n.Rmd: Rmarkdown code (text + code)\n.do: Stata code (script)\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening an Existing Script from Files\n\n\n\nIn R, there are two main types of scripts. A classic .R file and a .Rmd file (for Rmarkdown). A .R file is just lines and lines of R code that is meant to be inserted right into the Console. A .Rmd tries to weave code and English together, to make it easier for users to create reports that interact with data and intersperse R code with explanation. For example, we built this book in Rmds.\n\nThe Rmarkdown facilitates is the use of code chunks, which are used here. These start and end with three back-ticks. In the beginning, we can add options in curly braces ({}). Specifying r in the beginning tells to render it as R code. Options like echo = TRUE switch between showing the code that was executed or not; eval = TRUE switch between evaluating the code. More about Rmarkdown in Section Chapter 13. For example, this code chunk would evaluate 1 + 1 and show its output when compiled, but not display the code that was executed.\n\n\n\nA code chunk in Rmarkdown (before rendering)",

    "text": "7.2 But what is R?\nR is an object oriented programming language primarily used for statistical computing. An object oriented language is a programming language built around manipulating objects.\n\nIn R, objects can be matrices, vectors, scalars, strings, and data frames, for example\nObjects contain different types of information\nDifferent objects have different allowable procedures:\n\n\n# Adding a string and a string does not work because the '+' operator\n# does not work for strings:\n\n# 'Harvard' + 'Gov'\n\n# The '+' operator can add numbers just fine\n9 + 13\n\n[1] 22\n\n# Reminder: to figure out the type of an object use:\nx &lt;- 9\nclass(9)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(x)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(\"Harvard\")\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nObject oriented programming makes languages flexible and powerful:\n\nYou can create custom functions and objects for your needs\nOther people can create great packages for everyone to use\nMany errors come from using the wrong data type and a lot of programming in R is getting data into the right format and type to work with.\n\nIt is helpful to think in terms of object manipulation at a high level while programming in R, particularly at the beginning of tackling a new problem. Think about what objects you want to manipulate, what types they are, and how they fit together. Once you have the logic of your solution ready then you can write it in R.",

    "section": "7.4 Base-R vs. tidyverse",
    "text": "7.4 Base-R vs. tidyverse\nOne last thing before we jump into data. Many things in R and other open source packages have competing standards. A lecture on a technique inevitably biases one standard over another. Right now among R users in this area, there are two families of functions: base-R and tidyverse. R instructors thus face a dilemma about which to teach primarily.2\nIn this prefresher, we try our best to choose the one that is most useful to the modal task of social science researchers, and make use of the tidyverse functions in most applications. but feel free to suggest changes to us or to the booklet.\nAlthough you do not need to choose one over the other, for beginners it is confusing what is a tidyverse function and what is not. Many of the tidyverse packages are covered in this 2017 graphic below, and the cheat-sheets that other programmers have written: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/\n\n\n\nNames of Packages in the tidyverse Family\n\n\nThe following side-by-side comparison of commands for a particular function compares some tidyverse and non-tidyverse functions (which we refer to loosely as base-R). This list is not meant to be comprehensive and more to give you a quick rule of thumb.\n\nDataframe subsetting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to …\nin tidyverse:\nin base-R:\n\n\n\n\nCount each category\ncount(df, var)\ntable(df$var)\n\n\nFilter rows by condition\nfilter(df, var == \"Female\")\ndf[df$var == \"Female\", ] or subset(df, var == \"Female\")\n\n\nExtract columns\nselect(df, var1, var2)\ndf[, c(\"var1\", \"var2\")]\n\n\nExtract a single column as a vector\npull(df, var)\ndf[[\"var\"]] or df[, \"var\"]\n\n\nCombine rows\nbind_rows()\nrbind()\n\n\nCombine columns\nbind_cols()\ncbind()\n\n\nCreate a dataframe\ntibble(x = vec1, y = vec2)\ndata.frame(x = vec1, y = vec2)\n\n\nTurn a dataframe into a tidyverse dataframe\ntbl_df(df)\n\n\n\n\nRemember that tidyverse applies to dataframes only, not vectors. For subsetting vectors, use the base-R functions with the square brackets.\n\n\nRead data\nSome non-tidyverse functions are not quite “base-R” but have similar relationships to tidyverse. For these, we recommend using the tidyverse functions as a general rule due to their common format, simplicity, and scalability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to …\nin tidyverse:\nin base-R:\n\n\n\n\nRead a Excel file\nread_excel()\nread.xlsx()\n\n\nRead a csv\nread_csv()\nread.csv()\n\n\nRead a Stata file\nread_dta()\nread.dta()\n\n\nSubstitute strings\nstr_replace()\ngsub()\n\n\nReturn matching strings\nstr_subset()\ngrep(., value = TRUE)\n\n\nMerge data1 and data2 on variables x1 and x2\nleft_join(data1, data2, by = c(\"x1\", \"x2\"))\nmerge(data1, data2, by.x = \"x1\", by.y = \"x2\", all.x = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization\nPlotting by ggplot2 (from your tutorials) is also a tidyverse family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to …\nin tidyverse:\nin base-R:\n\n\n\n\nMake a scatter plot\nggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()\nplot(data$x, data$y)\n\n\nMake a line plot\nggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + geom_line()\nplot(data$x, data$y, type = \"l\")\n\n\nMake a histogram\nggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + geom_histogram()\nhist(data$x, data$y)\n\n\nMake a barplot\nSee Section Chapter 10\nSee Section Chapter 10",

    "text": "7.5 A is for Athens\nFor our first dataset, let’s try reading in a dataset on the Ancient Greek world. Political Theorists and Political Historians study the domestic systems, international wars, cultures and writing of this era to understand the first instance of democracy, the rise and overturning of tyranny, and the legacies of political institutions.\nThis POLIS dataset was generously provided by Professor Josiah Ober of Stanford University. This dataset includes information on city states in the Ancient Greek world, parts of it collected by careful work by historians and archaeologists. It is part of his recent books on Greece (Ober 2015), “The Rise and Fall of Classical Greece”3 and Institutions in Ancient Athens (Ober 2010) , “Democracy and Knowledge: Innovation and Learning in Classical Athens.”4\n\n7.5.1 Locating the Data\nWhat files do we have in the data/input folder?\n\n\ndata/input/Nunn_Wantchekon_AER_2011.dta data/input/Nunn_Wantchekon_sample.dta   \ndata/input/acs2015_1percent.csv         data/input/gapminder_wide.Rds           \ndata/input/gapminder_wide.tab           data/input/german_credit.sav            \ndata/input/justices_court-median.csv    data/input/ober_2018.xlsx               \ndata/input/sample_mid.csv               data/input/sample_polity.csv            \ndata/input/upshot-siena-polls.csv       data/input/usc2010_001percent.Rds       \ndata/input/usc2010_001percent.csv       \n\n\nA typical file format is Microsoft Excel. Although this is not usually the best format for R because of its highly formatted structure as opposed to plain text (more on this in Section @(sec:wysiwyg)), recent packages have made this fairly easy.\n\n\n7.5.2 Reading in Data\nIn Rstudio, a good way to start is to use the GUI and the Import tool. Once you click a file, an option to “Import Dataset” comes up. RStudio picks the right function for you, and you can copy that code, but it’s important to eventually be able to write that code yourself.\nFor the first time using an outside package, you first need to install it.\n\ninstall.packages(\"readxl\")\n\nAfter that, you don’t need to install it again. But you do need to load it each time.\n\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nThe package readxl has a website: https://readxl.tidyverse.org/. Other packages are not as user-friendly, but they have a help page with a table of contents of all their functions.\n\nhelp(package = readxl)\n\nFrom the help page, we see that read_excel() is the function that we want to use.\nLet’s try it.\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nober &lt;- read_excel(\"data/input/ober_2018.xlsx\")\n\nReview: what does the / mean? Why do we need the data term first?

It takes the thing on the left side and pipes it down to the function on the right side. We could have done count(cen10, race) as cen10 |&gt; count(race). That means take cen10 and pass it on to the function count, which will count observations by race and return a collapsed dataset with the categories in its own variable and their respective counts in n.\n\n\n\n7.5.5 Extra: A sneak peak at Ober’s data\nAlthough this is a bit beyond our current stage, it’s hard to resist the temptation to see what you can do with data like this. For example, you can map it.5\nUsing the ggmap package\n\nlibrary(ggmap)\n\nFirst get a map of the Greek world.\n\ngreece &lt;- get_map(\n  location = c(lon = 22.6382849, lat = 39.543287),\n  zoom = 5,\n  source = \"stamen\",\n  maptype = \"toner\"\n)\nggmap(greece)\n\n\nI chose the specifications for arguments zoom and maptype by looking at the webpage and Googling some examples.\nOber’s data has the latitude and longitude of each polis. Because the map of Greece has the same coordinates, we can add the polei on the same map.\n\ngg_ober &lt;- ggmap(greece) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = ober,\n    aes(y = Latitude, x = Longitude),\n    size = 0.5,\n    color = \"orange\"\n  )\ngg_ober +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(10, 35)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(32, 44)) +\n  theme_void()",

    "text": "Motivation\nNunn and Wantchekon (2011) – “The Slave Trade and the Origins of Mistrust in Africa”1 – argues that across African countries, the distrust of co-ethnics fueled by the slave trade has had long-lasting effects on modern day trust in these territories. They argued that the slave trade created distrust in these societies in part because as some African groups were employed by European traders to capture their neighbors and bring them to the slave ships.\nNunn and Wantchekon use a variety of statistical tools to make their case (adding controls, ordered logit, instrumental variables, falsification tests, causal mechanisms), many of which will be covered in future courses. In this module we will only touch on their first set of analysis that use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). OLS is likely the most common application of linear algebra in the social sciences. We will cover some linear algebra, matrix manipulation, and vector manipulation from this data.",

How many types of objects are there?\nThere are an infinite number of objects, because people make their own class of object. You can detect the type of the object (the class) by the function class\nObject can be said to be an instance of a class.\nAnalogies:\nclass - Pokemon, object - Pikachu\nclass - Book, object - To Kill a Mockingbird\nclass - DataFrame, object - 2010 census data\nclass - Character, object - “Programming is Fun”\nWhat is type (class) of object is cen10?\n\nclass(cen10)\n\n[1] \"spec_tbl_df\" \"tbl_df\"      \"tbl\"         \"data.frame\" \n\n\nWhat about this text?\n\nclass(\"some random text\")\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nTo change or create the class of any object, you can assign it. To do this, assign the name of your class to character to an object’s class().\nWe can start from a simple list. For example, say we wanted to store data about pokemon. Because there is no pre-made package for this, we decide to make our own class.\n\npikachu &lt;- list(\n  name = \"Pikachu\",\n  number = 25,\n  type = \"Electric\",\n  color = \"Yellow\"\n)\n\nand we can give it any class name we want.\n\nclass(pikachu) &lt;- \"Pokemon\"\nstr(pikachu)\n\nList of 4\n $ name  : chr \"Pikachu\"\n $ number: num 25\n $ type  : chr \"Electric\"\n $ color : chr \"Yellow\"\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"Pokemon\"\n\npikachu$type\n\n[1] \"Electric\"\n\n\n\n9.2.1 Seeing R through objects\nMost of the R objects that you will see as you advance are their own objects.

And even things like &lt;- and [ are functions as well.\nA function is a set of instructions with specified ingredients. It takes an input, then manipulates it – changes it in some way – and then returns the manipulated product.\nOne way to see what a function actually does is to enter it without parentheses.\n# enter this on your console\ntable\nYou’ll see below that the most basic functions are quite complicated internally.\nYou’ll notice that functions contain other functions. wrapper functions are functions that “wrap around” existing functions. This sounds redundant, but it’s an important feature of programming. If you find yourself repeating a command more than two times, you should make your own function, rather than writing the same type of code.\n\n9.4.1 Write your own function\nIt’s worth remembering the basic structure of a function. You create a new function, call it my_fun by this:\nmy_fun &lt;- function() {\n\n}\nIf we wanted to generate a function that computed the number of men in your data, what would that look like?\n\ncount_men &lt;- function(data) {\n  nmen &lt;- sum(data$sex == \"Male\")\n\n  return(nmen)\n}\n\nThen all we need to do is feed this function a dataset\n\ncount_men(cen10)\n\n[1] 15220\n\n\nThe point of a function is that you can use it again and again without typing up the set of constituent manipulations. So, what if we wanted to figure out the number of men in California?\n\ncount_men(cen10[cen10$state == \"California\", ])\n\n[1] 1876\n\n\nLet’s go one step further. What if we want to know the proportion of non-whites in a state, just by entering the name of the state? There’s multiple ways to do it, but it could look something like this\n\nnw_in_state &lt;- function(data, state) {\n  s.subset &lt;- data[data$state == state, ]\n  total.s &lt;- nrow(s.subset)\n  nw.s &lt;- sum(s.subset$race != \"White\")\n\n  nw.s / total.s\n}\n\nThe last line is what gets generated from the function. To be more explicit you can wrap the last line around return(). (as in return(nw.s/total.s). return() is used when you want to break out of a function in the middle of it and not wait till the last line.\nTry it on your favorite state!\n\nnw_in_state(cen10, \"Massachusetts\")\n\n[1] 0.2040185",

See the Law Review article by Persily (2011), “The Law of the Census.”1 The Census is government’s primary tool for apportionment (allocating seats to districts), appropriations (allocating federal funding), and tracking demographic change. See for example Hochschild and Powell (2008) on how the categorizations of race in the Census during 1850-1930.2 Notice also that both of these pieces are not inherently “quantitative” — the Persily article is a Law Review and the Hochschild and Powell article is on American Historical Development — but data analysis would be certainly relevant.\nTime series data is a common form of data in social science data, and there is growing methodological work on making causal inferences with time series.3 We will use the the ideological estimates of the Supreme court.",

    "text": "10.4 base R graphics and ggplot\nTwo prevalent ways of making graphing are referred to as “base-R” and “ggplot”.\n\n10.4.1 base R\n“Base-R” graphics are graphics that are made with R’s default graphics commands. First, let’s assign our tabulation to an object, then put it in the barplot() function.\n\nbarplot(table(cen10$race))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.4.2 ggplot\nA popular alternative a ggplot graphics, that you were introduced to in the tutorial. gg stands for grammar of graphics by Hadley Wickham, and it has a new semantics of explaining graphics in R. Again, first let’s set up the data.\nAlthough the tutorial covered making scatter plots as the first cut, often data requires summaries before they made into graphs.\nFor this example, let’s group and count first like we just did. But assign it to a new object.\n\ngrp_race &lt;- count(cen10, race)\n\nWe will now plot this grouped set of numbers. Recall that the ggplot() function takes two main arguments, data and aes.\n\nFirst enter a single dataframe from which you will draw a plot.\nThen enter the aes, or aesthetics. This defines which variable in the data the plotting functions should take for pre-set dimensions in graphics. The dimensions x and y are the most important. We will assign race and count to them, respectively,\nAfter you close ggplot() .. add layers by the plus sign. A geom is a layer of graphical representation, for example geom_histogram renders a histogram, geom_point renders a scatter plot. For a barplot, we can use geom_col()\n\nWhat is the right geometry layer to make a barplot? Turns out:\n\nggplot(data = grp_race, aes(x = race, y = n)) +\n  geom_col()",

    "text": "10.5 Improving your graphics\nAdjusting your graphics to make the point clear is an important skill. Here is a base-R example of showing the same numbers but with a different design, in a way that aims to maximize the “data-to-ink ratio”.\n\npar(oma = c(1, 11, 1, 1))\nbarplot(sort(table(cen10$race)), # sort numbers\n  horiz = TRUE, # flip\n  border = NA, # border is extraneous\n  xlab = \"Number in Race Category\",\n  bty = \"n\", # no box\n  las = 1\n) # alignment of axis labels is horizontal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we applied the sort() function to order the bars in terms of their counts. The default ordering of a categorical variable / factor is alphabetical. Alphabetical ordering is uninformative and almost never the way you should order variables.\nIn ggplot you might do this by:\n\nlibrary(forcats)\n\ngrp_race_ordered &lt;- arrange(grp_race, n) |&gt;\n  mutate(race = as_factor(race))\n\nggplot(data = grp_race_ordered, aes(x = race, y = n)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Number in Race Category\",\n    x = \"\",\n    caption = \"Source: 2010 U.S. Census sample\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data ink ratio was popularized by Ed Tufte (originally a political economy scholar who has recently become well known for his data visualization work). See Tufte (2001), The Visual Display of Quantitative Information and his website https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/.

Say we’d like to compare the racial composition of a small state (like Delaware) and a large state (like California). In fact, most tasks of inference is about the unobserved population, not the observed data — and proportions are estimates of a quantity in the population.\nOne way to transform a table of counts to a table of proportions is the function prop.table. Be careful what you want to take proportions of – this is set by the margin argument. In R, the first margin (margin = 1) is rows and the second (margin = 2) is columns.\n\nptab_race_state &lt;- prop.table(xtab_race_state, margin = 2)\n\nCheck out each of these table objects in your console and familiarize yourself with the difference.",

But take a moment to see why the code was written as it is and how that maps on to the graphics. What is the group aesthetic doing for you?\nNow, this graphic already indicates a lot, but let’s improve the graphics so people can actually read it. This is left for a Exercise.\nAs social scientists, we should also not forget to ask ourselves whether these numerical measures are fit for what we care about, or actually succeeds in measuring what we’d like to measure. The estimation of these “ideal points” is a subfield of political methodology beyond this prefresher.

Order doesn’t matter.\n\n1: Rural states\nMake a well-labelled figure that plots the proportion of the state’s population (as per the census) that is 65 years or older. Each state should be visualized as a point, rather than a bar, and there should be 51 points, ordered by their value. All labels should be readable.\n\n# Enter yourself\n\n\n\n2: The swing justice\nUsing the justices_court-median.csv dataset and building off of the plot that was given, make an improved plot by implementing as many of the following changes (which hopefully improves the graph):\n\nLabel axes\nUse a black-white background.\nChange the breaks of the x-axis to print numbers for every decade, not just every two decades.\nPlots each line in translucent gray, so the overlapping lines can be visualized clearly. (Hint: in ggplot the alpha argument controls the degree of transparency)\nLimit the scale of the y-axis to [-5, 5] so that the outlier justice in the 60s is trimmed and the rest of the data can be seen more easily (also, who is that justice?)\nPlot the ideal point of the justice who holds the “median” ideal point in a given term. To distinguish this with the others, plot this line separately in a very light red below the individual justice’s lines.\nHighlight the trend-line of only the nine justices who are currently sitting on SCOTUS. Make sure this is clearer than the other past justices.\nAdd the current nine justice’s names to the right of the endpoint of the 2016 figure, alongside their ideal point.\nMake sure the text labels do not overlap with each other for readability using the ggrepel package.\nExtend the x-axis label to about 2020 so the text labels of justices are to the right of the trend-lines.\nAdd a caption to your text describing the data briefly, as well as any features relevant for the reader (such as the median line and the trimming of the y-axis)\n\n\n# Enter yourself\n\n\n\n3: Don’t sort by the alphabet\nThe Figure we made that shows racial composition by state has one notable shortcoming: it orders the states alphabetically, which is not particularly useful if you want see an overall pattern, without having particular states in mind.\nFind a way to modify the figures so that the states are ordered by the proportion of White residents in the sample.\n\n# Enter yourself\n\n\n\n4 What to show and how to show it\nAs a student of politics our goal is not necessarily to make pretty pictures, but rather make pictures that tell us something about politics, government, or society.

    "text": "Motivation\nThe “Democratic Peace” is one of the most widely discussed propositions in political science, covering the fields of International Relations and Comparative Politics, with insights to domestic politics of democracies (e.g. American Politics). The one-sentence idea is that democracies do not fight with each other. There have been much theoretical debate – for example in earlier work, Oneal and Russet (1999) argue that the democratic peace is not due to the hegemony of strong democracies like the U.S. and attempt to distinguish between realist and what they call Kantian propositions (e.g. democratic governance, international organizations)1.\nAn empirical demonstration of the democratic peace is also a good example of a Time Series Cross Sectional (or panel) dataset, where the same units (in this case countries) are observed repeatedly for multiple time periods. Experience in assembling and analyzing a TSCS dataset will prepare you for any future research in this area.",

In day 1, we used the package readxl, using the read_excel() function.\n\n\nTask 2: Data Merging\nWe will use data to test a version of the Democratic Peace Thesis (DPS). Democracies are said to go to war less because the leaders who wage wars are accountable to voters who have to bear the costs of war. Are democracies less likely to engage in militarized interstate disputes?\nTo start, let’s download and merge some data.\n\nLoad in the Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) files. Militarized interstate disputes are hostile action between two formally recognized states. Examples of this would be threats to use force, threats to declare war, beginning war, fortifying a border with troops, and so on.\nFind a way to merge the Polity IV dataset and the MID data. This process can be a bit tricky.\nAn advanced version of this task would be to download the dyadic form of the data and try merging that with polity.\n\n\n\nTask 3: Tabulations and Visualization\n\nCalculate the mean Polity2 score by year. Plot the result. Use graphical indicators of your choosing to show where key events fall in this timeline (such as 1914, 1929, 1939, 1989, 2008). Speculate on why the behavior from 1800 to 1920 seems to be qualitatively different than behavior afterwards.\nDo the same but only among state-years that were involved in a MID. Plot this line together with your results from 1.\nDo the same but only among state years that were not involved in a MID.\nArrive at a tentative conclusion for how well the Democratic Peace argument seems to hold up in this dataset.

The argument prob handles this.\nFor example, this simulates 20 fair coin tosses (each outcome is equally likely to happen)\n\nsample(c(\"Head\", \"Tail\"), size = 20, prob = c(0.5, 0.5), replace = TRUE)\n\n [1] \"Head\" \"Head\" \"Head\" \"Head\" \"Head\" \"Head\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Head\"\n[11] \"Head\" \"Head\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Head\" \"Head\" \"Tail\" \"Head\" \"Tail\"\n\n\nBut this simulates 20 biased coin tosses, where say the probability of Tails is 4 times more likely than the number of Heads\n\nsample(c(\"Head\", \"Tail\"), size = 20, prob = c(0.2, 0.8), replace = TRUE)\n\n [1] \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Head\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Head\"\n[11] \"Head\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\" \"Tail\"\n\n\n\n12.2.1 Sampling rows from a dataframe\nIn tidyverse, there is a convenience function to sample rows randomly: sample_n() and sample_frac().\nFor example, load the dataset on cars, mtcars, which has 32 observations.\n\nmtcars\n\n                     mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4           21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag       21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710          22.8   4 108.0  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive      21.4   6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout   18.7   8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant             18.1   6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\nDuster 360          14.3   8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84  0  0    3    4\nMerc 240D           24.4   4 146.7  62 3.69 3.190 20.00  1  0    4    2\nMerc 230            22.8   4 140.8  95 3.92 3.150 22.90  1  0    4    2\nMerc 280            19.2   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30  1  0    4    4\nMerc 280C           17.8   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90  1  0    4    4\nMerc 450SE          16.4   8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40  0  0    3    3\nMerc 450SL          17.3   8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60  0  0    3    3\nMerc 450SLC         15.2   8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00  0  0    3    3\nCadillac Fleetwood  10.4   8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98  0  0    3    4\nLincoln Continental 10.4   8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82  0  0    3    4\nChrysler Imperial   14.7   8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42  0  0    3    4\nFiat 128            32.4   4  78.7  66 4.08 2.200 19.47  1  1    4    1\nHonda Civic         30.4   4  75.7  52 4.93 1.615 18.52  1  1    4    2\nToyota Corolla      33.9   4  71.1  65 4.22 1.835 19.90  1  1    4    1\nToyota Corona       21.5   4 120.1  97 3.70 2.465 20.01  1  0    3    1\nDodge Challenger    15.5   8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87  0  0    3    2\nAMC Javelin         15.2   8 304.0 150 3.15 3.435 17.30  0  0    3    2\nCamaro Z28          13.3   8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41  0  0    3    4\nPontiac Firebird    19.2   8 400.0 175 3.08 3.845 17.05  0  0    3    2\nFiat X1-9           27.3   4  79.0  66 4.08 1.935 18.90  1  1    4    1\nPorsche 914-2       26.0   4 120.3  91 4.43 2.140 16.70  0  1    5    2\nLotus Europa        30.4   4  95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90  1  1    5    2\nFord Pantera L      15.8   8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50  0  1    5    4\nFerrari Dino        19.7   6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50  0  1    5    6\nMaserati Bora       15.0   8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60  0  1    5    8\nVolvo 142E          21.4   4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60  1  1    4    2\n\n\nsample_n picks a user-specified number of rows from the dataset:\n\nsample_n(mtcars, 3)\n\n            mpg cyl  disp hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nDatsun 710 22.8   4 108.0 93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nFiat 128   32.4   4  78.7 66 4.08 2.200 19.47  1  1    4    1\nFiat X1-9  27.3   4  79.0 66 4.08 1.935 18.90  1  1    4    1\n\n\nSometimes you want a X percent sample of your dataset.

(Think: flipping a coin –&gt; can be perfectly predicted if I know wind speed, the angle the coin is flipped, etc.). Some people use random noise in the atmosphere or random behavior in quantum systems to generate “truly” (?) random numbers. Conversely, R uses deterministic algorithms which take as an input a “seed” and which then perform a series of operations to generate a sequence of random-seeming numbers (that is, numbers whose sequence is sufficiently hard to predict).\nLet’s think about this another way. Sampling is a stochastic process, so every time you run sample() or runif() you are bound to get a different output (because different random seeds are used). This is intentional in some cases but you might want to avoid it in others. For example, you might want to diagnose a coding discrepancy by setting the random number generator to give the same number each time. To do this, use the function set.seed().\nIn the function goes any number. When you run a sample function in the same command as a preceding set.seed(), the sampling function will always give you the same sequence of numbers.

    "text": "Exercises\n\nCensus Sampling\nWhat can we learn from surveys of populations, and how wrong do we get if our sampling is biased?5 Suppose we want to estimate the proportion of U.S. residents who are non-white (race != \"White\"). In reality, we do not have any population dataset to utilize and so we only see the sample survey. Here, however, to understand how sampling works, let’s conveniently use the Census extract in some cases and pretend we didn’t in others.\n\nFirst, load usc2010_001percent.csv into your R session. After loading the library(tidyverse), browse it. Although this is only a 0.01 percent extract, treat this as your population for pedagogical purposes. What is the population proportion of non-White residents?\n\n\nSetting a seed to 1669482, sample 100 respondents from this sample. What is the proportion of non-White residents in this particular sample? By how many percentage points are you off from (what we labelled as) the true proportion?\n\n\nNow imagine what you did above was one survey. What would we get if we did 20 surveys?\n\nTo simulate this, write a loop that does the same exercise 20 times, each time computing a sample proportion. Use the same seed at the top, but be careful to position the set.seed function such that it generates the same sequence of 20 samples, rather than 20 of the same sample.\nTry doing this with a for loop and storing your sample proportions in a new length-20 vector. (Suggestion: make an empty vector first as a container). After running the loop, show a histogram of the 20 values. Also what is the average of the 20 sample estimates?\n\nNow, to make things more real, let’s introduce some response bias. The goal here is not to correct response bias but to induce it and see how it affects our estimates. Suppose that non-White residents are 10 percent less likely to respond to enter your survey than White respondents. This is plausible if you think that the Census is from 2010 but you are polling in 2018, and racial minorities are more geographically mobile than Whites. Repeat the same exercise in (c) by modeling this behavior.\n\nYou can do this by creating a variable, e.g. propensity, that is 0.9 for non-Whites and 1 otherwise. Then, you can refer to it in the propensity argument.\n\nFinally, we want to see if more data (“Big Data”) will improve our estimates. Using the same unequal response rates framework as (d), repeat the same exercise but instead of each poll collecting 100 responses, we collect 10,000.\n\n\nOptional - visualize your 2 pairs of 20 estimates, with a bar showing the “correct” population average.\n\n\n\nConditional Proportions\nThis example is not on simulation, but is meant to reinforce some of the probability discussion from math lecture.\nRead in the Upshot Siena poll from Fall 2016, data/input/upshot-siena-polls.csv.\nIn addition to some standard demographic questions, we will focus on one called vt_pres_2 in the csv. This is a two-way presidential vote question, asking respondents who they plan to vote for President if the election were held today – Donald Trump, the Republican, or Hilary Clinton, the Democrat, with options for Other candidates as well. For this problem, use the two-way vote question rather than the 4-way vote question.\n\nDrop the the respondents who answered the November poll (i.e. those for which poll == \"November\"). We do this in order to ignore this November population in all subsequent parts of this question because they were not asked the Presidential vote question.\n\n\nUsing the dataset after the procedure in (a), find the proportion of poll respondents (those who are in the sample) who support Donald Trump.\n\n\nAmong those who supported Donald Trump, what proportion of them has a Bachelor’s degree or higher (i.e. have a Bachelor’s, Graduate, or other Professional Degree)?\nAmong those who did not support Donald Trump (i.e. including supporters of Hilary Clinton, another candidate, or those who refused to answer the question), what proportion of them has a Bachelor’s degree or higher?\nExpress the numbers in the previous parts as probabilities of specified events. Define your own symbols: For example, we can let \\(T\\) be the event that a randomly selected respondent in the poll supports Donald Trump, then the proportion in part (b) is the probability \\(P(T).\\)\nSuppose we randomly sampled a person who participated in the survey and found that he/she had a Bachelor’s degree or higher. Given this evidence, what is the probability that the same person supports Donald Trump? Use Bayes Rule and show your work – that is, do not use data or R to compute the quantity directly. Then, verify this is the case via R.\n\n\n\nThe Birthday problem\nWrite code that will answer the well-known birthday problem via simulation.6\nThe problem is fairly simple: Suppose \\(k\\) people gather together in a room. What is the probability at least two people share the same birthday?\nTo simplify reality a bit, assume that (1) there are no leap years, and so there are always 365 days in a year, and (2) a given individual’s birthday is randomly assigned and independent from each other.\nStep 1: Set k to a concrete number. Pick a number from 1 to 365 randomly, k times to simulate birthdays (would this be with replacement or without?).\n\n# Your code\n\nStep 2: Write a line (or two) of code that gives a TRUE or FALSE statement of whether or not at least two people share the same birth date.\n\n# Your code\n\nStep 3: The above steps will generate a TRUE or FALSE answer for your event of interest, but only for one realization of an event in the sample space. In order to estimate the probability of your event happening, we need a “stochastic”, as opposed to “deterministic”, method. To do this, write a loop that does Steps 1 and 2 repeatedly for many times, call that number of times sims. For each of sims iteration, your code should give you a TRUE or FALSE answer. Code up a way to store these estimates.\n\n# Your code\n\nStep 4: Finally, generalize the function further by letting k be a user-defined number. You have now created a Monte Carlo simulation!\n\n# Your code\n\nStep 5: Generate a table or plot that shows how the probability of sharing a birthday changes by k (fixing sims at a large number like 1000). Also generate a similar plot that shows how the probability of sharing a birthday changes by sims (fixing k at some arbitrary number like 10).\n\n# Your code\n\nExtra credit: Give an “analytical” answer to this problem, that is an answer through deriving the mathematical expressions of the probability.\n\n# Your equations",

Of course, some programming technologies are quite “old”: (C in 1969, C++ around 1989, TeX in 1978, Linux in 1991, Mac OS in 1984). But it is easy to feel you are falling behind in the recent developments of programming. Today we will do a brief and rough overview of some fundamental and new tools other than R, with the general aim of having you break out of your comfort zone so you won’t be shut out from learning these tools in the future.",

    "text": "13.2 Markdown\nMarkdown is the text we have been using throughout this course! At its core markdown is just plain text. Plain text does not have any formatting embedded in it. Instead, the formatting is coded up as text. Markdown is not a WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) text editor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. This will mean that you need to explicitly code for bold{text} rather than hitting Command+B and making your text look bold on your own computer.\nMarkdown is known as a “light-weight” editor, which means that it is relatively easy to write code that will compile. It is quick and easy and satisfies most presentation purposes; you might want to try LaTeX for more involved papers.\n\n13.2.1 Markdown commands\nFor italic and bold, use either the asterisks or the underlines,\n*italic*   **bold**\n_italic_   __bold__\nAnd for headers use the hash symbols,\n# Main Header\n## Sub-headers\n\n\n13.2.2 Your own markdown\nRStudio makes it easy to compile your very first markdown file by giving you templates. Got to New &gt; R Markdown, pick a document and click Ok. This will give you a skeleton of a document you can compile – or “knit”.\nRmd is actually a slight modification of real markdown. It is a type of file that R reads and turns into a proper md file. Then, it uses a document-conversion called pandoc to compile your md into documents like PDF or HTML.\n\n\n\nHow Rmds become PDFs or HTMLs\n\n\n\n\n13.2.3 Quarto\nR Markdown (.Rmd) files have long been the go-to for reproducible writing workflows for R users. In 2022, Posit, PBC, who created R Markdown announced a new generation of markdown extensions, with Quarto. Quarto (.qmd) files are a variation on R Markdown which allows for including R, python, Observable, Julia, and more within a document. Quarto is largely compatible with older .Rmd files, just by changing the extension. As such, you can integrate LaTeX and markdown seamlessly.\nSome benefits of using Quarto include:\n\nease of customization with template partials\njournal submission templates for many journals\ndozen of output types\nthe ability to make websites interacting only with Quarto\n\n\n\n13.2.4 A note on plain-text editors\nMultiple software exist where you can edit plain-text (roughly speaking, text that is not WYSIWYG).\n\nRStudio (especially for R-related links)\nTeXMaker, TeXShop (especially for TeX)\nemacs, aquamacs (general)\nvim (general)\nSublime Text (general)\n\nEach has their own keyboard shortcuts and special features. You can browse a couple and see which one(s) you like.\nSince June 2021, RStudio has offered a visual editor which tries to bridge the gap between plain-text and WYSIWYG. While writing, it transforms plain markdown, RMarkdown, or Quarto documents into a “WYSISWYM” version, What You See Is What You Mean. Formatting choices, like bold or italicized text are shown as bold or italicized text, rather than as intermediate markdown. Lists, enumerations, and images are shown inline, rather than the code that includes them. This is not a final form though, as styling still occurs when rendering the final document.",

    "text": "13.3 LaTeX\nLaTeX is a typesetting program. You’d engage with LaTeX much like you engage with your R code. You will interact with LaTeX in a text editor, and will writing code which will be interpreted by the LaTeX compiler and which will finally be parsed to form your final PDF.\n\n13.3.1 Compile online\n\nGo to https://www.overleaf.com\nScroll down and go to “CREATE A NEW PAPER” if you don’t have an account.\nLet’s discuss the default template.\nMake a new document, and set it as your main document. Then type in the Minimal Working Example (MWE):\n\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\begin{document}\nHello World\n\\end{document}\n\n\n13.3.2 Compile your first LaTeX document locally\nLaTeX is a very stable system, and few changes to it have been made since the 1990s. The main benefit: better control over how your papers will look; better methods for writing equations or making tables; overall pleasing aesthetic.\n\nOpen a plain text editor. Then type in the MWE\n\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\begin{document}\nHello World\n\\end{document}\n\nSave this as hello_world.tex. Make sure you get the file extension right.\nOpen this in your “LaTeX” editor. This can be TeXMaker, Aqumacs, etc..\nGo through the click/dropdown interface and click compile.\n\n\n\n13.3.3 Main LaTeX commands\nLaTeX can cover most of your typesetting needs, to clean equations and intricate diagrams.\nSome main commands you’ll be using are below, and a very concise cheat sheet here: https://wch.github.io/latexsheet/latexsheet.pdf\nMost involved features require that you begin a specific “environment” for that feature, clearly demarcating them by the notation \\begin{figure} and then \\end{figure}, e.g. in the case of figures.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics{histogram.pdf}\n\\end{figure}\nwhere histogram.pdf is a path to one of your files.\nNotice that each line starts with a backslash \\ – in LaTeX this is the symbol to run a command.\nThe following syntax at the endpoints are shorthand for math equations.\n$$\\int x^2 dx$$\nthese compile math symbols: \\(\\displaystyle \\int x^2 dx.\\)1\nThe align environment is useful to align your multi-line math, for example.\n\\begin{align}\nP(A \\mid B) &= \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{P(B \\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}\n\\end{align}\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP(A \\mid B) &= \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{P(B \\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}\n\\end{align}\\]\nRegression tables should be outputted as .tex files with packages like xtable and stargazer, and then called into LaTeX by \\input{regression_table.tex} where regression_table.tex is the path to your regression output.\nFigures and equations should be labelled with the tag (e.g. label{tab:regression} so that you can refer to them later with their tag Table \\ref{tab:regression}, instead of hard-coding Table 2).\nFor some LaTeX commands you might need to load a separate package that someone else has written. Do this in your preamble (i.e. before \\begin{document}):\n\\usepackage[options]{package}\nwhere package is the name of the package and options are options specific to the package.\n\n\nFurther Guides\nFor a more comprehensive listing of LaTeX commands, Mayya Komisarchik has a great tutorial set of folders: https://scholar.harvard.edu/mkomisarchik/tutorials-0\nThere is a version of LaTeX called Beamer, which is a popular way of making a slideshow. Slides in markdown is also a competitor. The language of Beamer is the same as LaTeX but has some special functions for slides.",

    "text": "13.4 BibTeX\nBibTeX is a reference system for bibliographical tests. We have a .bib file separately on our computer. This is also a plain text file, but it encodes bibliographical resources with special syntax so that a program can rearrange parts accordingly for different citation systems.\n\n13.4.1 What is a .bib file?\nFor example, here is the Nunn and Wantchekon article entry in .bib form.\n@article{nunn2011slave,\n  title={The Slave Trade and the Origins of Mistrust in Africa},\n  author={Nunn, Nathan and Wantchekon, Leonard},\n  journal={American Economic Review},\n  volume={101},\n  number={7},\n  pages={3221--3252},\n  year={2011}\n}\nThe first entry, nunn2011slave, is “pick your favorite” – pick your own name for your reference system. The other slots in this @article entry are entries that refer to specific bibliographical text.\n\n\n13.4.2 What does LaTeX do with .bib files?\nNow, in LaTeX, if you type\n  \\textcite{nunn2011slave} argue that current variation in the trust among citizens of African countries has historical roots in the European slave trade in the 1600s.\nas part of your text, then when the .tex file is compiled the PDF shows something like\n\nin whatever citation style (APSA, APA, Chicago) you pre-specified!\nAlso at the end of your paper you will have a bibliography with entries ordered and formatted in the appropriate citation.\n\nThis is a much less frustrating way of keeping track of your references – no need to hand-edit formatting the bibliography to conform to citation rules (which biblatex already knows) and no need to update your bibliography as you add and drop references (biblatex will only show entries that are used in the main text).\n\n\n13.4.3 Stocking up on your .bib files\nYou should keep your own .bib file that has all your bibliographical resources. Storing entries is cheap (does not take much memory), so it is fine to keep all your references in one place (but you’ll want to make a new one for collaborative projects where multiple people will compile a .tex file).\nFor example, Gary’s BibTeX file is here: https://github.com/iqss-research/gkbibtex/blob/master/gk.bib\nCitation management software (Mendeley or Zotero) automatically generates .bib entries from your library of PDFs for you, provided you have the bibliography attributes right.",

    "text": "14.5 Regular expressions\nA regular expression is a special text string for describing a search pattern. They are most often used in functions for detecting, locating, and replacing desired text in a corpus.\nUse cases:\n\nTEXT PARSING. E.g. I have 10000 congressional speaches. Find all those which mention Iran.\nWEB SCRAPING. E.g. Parse html code in order to extract research information from an online table.\nCLEANING DATA. E.g. After loading in a dataset, we might need to remove mistakes from the dataset, orsubset the data using regular expression tools.\n\nExample in R. Extract the tweet mentioning Indonesia.\n\ns1 &lt;- \"If only Bradley's arm was longer. RT\"\ns2 &lt;- \"Share our love in Indonesia and in the World. RT if you agree.\"\nmy_string &lt;- c(s1, s2)\ngrepl(my_string, pattern = \"Indonesia\")\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE\n\nmy_string[grepl(my_string, pattern = \"Indonesia\")]\n\n[1] \"Share our love in Indonesia and in the World. RT if you agree.\"\n\n\nKey point: Many R commands use regular expressions. See ?grepl. Assume that x is a character vector and that pattern is the target pattern. In the earlier example, x could have been something like my_string and pattern would have been “Indonesia”. Here are other key uses:\n\nDETECT PATTERNS. grepl(pattern, x) goes through all the entries of x and returns a string of TRUE and FALSE values of the same size as x. It will return a TRUE whenever that string entry has the target pattern, and FALSE whenever it doesn’t.\nREPLACE PATTERNS. gsub(pattern, x, replacement) goes through all the entries of x replaces the pattern with replacement.\n\n\ngsub(\n  x = my_string,\n  pattern = \"o\",\n  replacement = \"AAAA\"\n)\n\n[1] \"If AAAAnly Bradley's arm was lAAAAnger. RT\"                                   \n[2] \"Share AAAAur lAAAAve in IndAAAAnesia and in the WAAAArld. RT if yAAAAu agree.\"\n\n\n\nLOCATE PATTERNS. regexpr(pattern, text) goes through each element of the character string. It returns a vector of the same length, with the entries of the vector corresponding to the location of the first pattern match, or a -1 if no match was obtained.\n\n\nregex_object &lt;- regexpr(pattern = \"was\", text = my_string)\nattr(regex_object, \"match.length\")\n\n[1]  3 -1\n\nattr(regex_object, \"useBytes\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nregexpr(pattern = \"was\", text = my_string)[1]\n\n[1] 23\n\nregexpr(pattern = \"was\", text = my_string)[2]\n\n[1] -1\n\n\nSeems simple? The problem: the patterns can get pretty complex!\n\n14.5.1 Character classes\nSome types of symbols are stand in for some more complex thing, rather than taken literally.\n[[:digit:]] Matches with all digits.\n[[:lower:]] Matches with lower case letters.\n[[:alpha:]] Matches with all alphabetic characters.\n[[:punct:]] Matches with all punctuation characters.\n[[:cntrl:]] Matches with “control” characters such as \\n, \\r, etc.\nExample in R:\n\nmy_string &lt;- \"Do you think that 34% of apples are red?\"\ngsub(my_string, pattern = \"[[:digit:]]\", replace = \"DIGIT\")\n\n[1] \"Do you think that DIGITDIGIT% of apples are red?\"\n\ngsub(my_string, pattern = \"[[:alpha:]]\", replace = \"\")\n\n[1] \"    34%    ?\"\n\n\n\n\n14.5.2 Special Characters.\nCertain characters (such as ., *, \\) have special meaning in the regular expressions framework (they are used to form conditional patterns as discussed below). Thus, when we want our pattern to explicitly include those characters as characters, we must “escape” them by using \\ or encoding them in \\Q…\\E.\nExample in R:\n\nmy_string &lt;- \"Do *really* think he will win?\"\ngsub(my_string, pattern = \"\\\\*\", replace = \"\")\n\n[1] \"Do really think he will win?\"\n\n\n\nmy_string &lt;- \"Now be brave! \\n Dread what comrades say of you here in combat! \"\ngsub(my_string, pattern = \"\\\\\\n\", replace = \"\")\n\n[1] \"Now be brave!  Dread what comrades say of you here in combat! \"\n\n\n\n\n14.5.3 Conditional patterns\n[] The target characters to match are located between the brackets. For example, [aAbB] will match with the characters a, A, b, B.\n[^...] Matches with everything except the material between the brackets. For example, [^aAbB] will match with everything but the characters a, A, b, B.\n(?=) Lookahead – match something that IS followed by the pattern.\n(?!) Negative lookahead — match something that is NOT followed by the pattern.\n(?&lt;=) Lookbehind – match with something that follows the pattern.\n\nmy_string &lt;- \"Do you think that 34%of the 23%of apples are red?\"\ngsub(my_string, pattern = \"(?&lt;=%)\", replace = \" \", perl = TRUE)\n\n[1] \"Do you think that 34% of the 23% of apples are red?\"\n\n\n\nmy_string &lt;- c(\n  \"legislative1_term1.png\",\n  \"legislative1_term1.pdf\",\n  \"legislative1_term2.png\",\n  \"legislative1_term2.pdf\",\n  \"term2_presidential1.png\",\n  \"presidential1.png\",\n  \"presidential1_term2.png\",\n  \"presidential1_term1.pdf\",\n  \"presidential1_term2.pdf\"\n)\n\ngrepl(my_string, pattern = \"^(?!presidential1).*\\\\.png\", perl = TRUE)\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n\nIndicates which file names don’t start with presidential1 but do end in .png\n^ indicates that the pattern should start at the beginning of the string.\n?! indicates negative lookahead – we’re looking for any pattern NOT following presidential1 which meets the subsequent conditions. (see below)\nThe first . indicates that, following the negative lookahead, there can be any characters and the * says that it doesn’t matter how many. Note that we have to escape the . in .png. (by writing \\\\. instead of just .)\n\nYou will have the chance to try out some regular expressions for yourself at the end!",

    "text": "14.6 Representing Text\nIn courses and research, we often want to analyze text, to extract meaning out of it. One of the key decisions we need to make is how to represent the text as numbers. Once the text is represented numerically, we can then apply a host of statistical and machine learning methods to it. Those methods are discussed more in the Gov methods sequence (Gov 2000-2003). Here’s a summary of the decisions you must make:\n\nWHICH TEXT TO USE? Which text do I want to analyze? What is my universe of documents?\nHOW TO REPRESENT THE TEXT NUMERICALLY? How do I use numbers to represent different things about the text?\nHOW TO ANALYZE THE NUMERICAL REPRESENTATION? How do I extract meaning out of the numerical representation?\n\nRepresenting text numerically.\n\nDocument term matrix. The document term matrix (DTM) is a common method for representing text. The DTM is a matrix. Each row of this matrix corresponds to a document; each column corresponds to a word. It is often useful to look at summary statistics such as the percentage of speaches in which a Democratic lawmaker used the word “inequality” compared to a Republican; the DTM would be very helpful for this and other tasks.\n\n\ndoc1 &lt;- \"Rage---Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus’ son Achilles,\n         murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses,\n         hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls,\n         great fighters’ souls.\"\ndoc2 &lt;- \"And fate?

    "text": "15.3 command-line\nElementary programming operations are done on the command-line, or by entering commands into your computer. This is different from a UI or GUI – graphical user-interface – which are interfaces that allow you to click buttons and enter commands in more readable form. Although there are good enough GUIs for most of your needs, you still might need to go under the hood sometimes and run a command.\n\n15.3.1 command-line commands\nOpen up Terminal in a Mac. (Command Prompt in Windows)\nRunning this command in a Mac (dir in Windows) should show you a list of all files in the directory that you are currently in.\nls\npwd stands for present working directory (cd in Windows)\npwd\ncd means change directory. You need to give it what to change your current directory to. You can specify a name of another directory in your directory.\nOr you can go up to your parent directory. The syntax for that are two periods, .. . One period . refers to the current directory.\ncd ..\npwd\n~/ stands for your home directory defined by your computer.\ncd ~/\nls\nUsing .. and . are “relative” to where you are currently at. So are things like figures/figure1.pdf, which is implicitly writing ./figures/figure1.pdf. These are called relative paths. In contrast, /Users/shirokuriwaki/project1/figures/figure1.pdf is an “absolute” path because it does not start from your current directory.\nRelative paths are nice if you have a shared Dropbox, for example, and I had /Users/shirokuriwaki/mathcamp but Connor’s path to the same folder is /Users/connorjerzak/mathcamp. To run the same code in mathcamp, we should be using relative paths that start from “mathcamp”. Relative paths are also shorter, and they are invariant to higher-level changes in your computer.\n\n\n15.3.2 Running things via command-line\nSuppose you have a simple Rscript, call it hello_world.R. This is simply a plain text file that contains\ncat(\"Hello World\")\nThen in command-line, go to the directory that contains hello_world.R and enter\nRscript hello_world.R\nThis should give you the output Hello World, which verifies that you “executed” the file with R via the command-line.\n\n\n15.3.3 why do command-line?\nIf you know exactly what you want to do your files and the changes are local, then command-line might be faster and be more sensible than navigating yourself through a GUI. For example, what if you wanted a single command that will run 10 R scripts successively at once (as Gentzkow and Shapiro suggest you should do in your research)? It is tedious to run each of your scripts on Rstudio, especially if running some take more than a few minutes. Instead you could write a “batch” script that you can run on the terminal,\nRscript 01_read_data.R\nRscript 02_merge_data.R\nRscript 03_run_regressions.R\nRscript 04_make_graphs.R\nRscript 05_maketable.R\nThen run this single file, call it run_all_Rscripts.sh, on your terminal as\nsh run_all_Rscripts.sh\nOn the other hand, command-line prompts may require more keystrokes, and is also less intuitive than a good GUI. It can also be dangerous for beginners, because it can allow you to make large irreversible changes inadvertently. For example, removing a file (rm) has no “Undo” feature.",

    "text": "15.4 git\nGit is a tool for version control. It comes pre-installed on Macs, you will probably need to install it yourself on Windows.\n\n15.4.1 Why version control?\nAll version control software should be built to\n\npreserve all snapshots of your work\nand catalog them in such a way that you can refer back or even revert back your files to the past snapshot.\nmakes it easy to see exactly which parts of your files you changed between directories.\n\nFurther, git is most commonly used for collaborative work.\n\nmaintains “branches”, or parallel universes of your files that people can switch back and forth on, doing version control on each one\nmakes it easy to “merge” a sub-branch to a master branch when it is ready.\n\nNote that Dropbox is useful for collaborative work too. But the added value of git’s branches is that people can make different changes simultaneously on their computers and merge them to the master branch later. In Dropbox, there is only one copy of each thing so simultaneous editing is not possible.\n\n\n15.4.2 Open-source code at your fingertips\nSome links to check out:\n\nhttps://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr\nhttps://github.com/apple/swift\nhttps://github.com/kosukeimai/qss\n\nGitHub https://github.com is the GUI to git. Making an account there is free. Making an account will allow you to be a part of the collaborative programming community. It will also allow you to “fork” other people’s “repositories”. “Forking” is making your own copy of the project that forks off from the master project at a point in time. A “repository” is simply the name of your main project directory.\n“cloning” someone else’s repository is similar to forking – it gives you your own copy.\n\n\n15.4.3 Commands in git\nAs you might have noticed from all the quoted terms, git uses a lot of its own terms that are not intuitive and hard to remember at first. The nuts and bolts of maintaining your version control further requires “adding”, “committing”, and “push”ing, sometimes “pull”ing.\nThe tutorial https://try.github.io/ is quite good. You’d want to have familiarity with command-line to fully understand this and use it in your work.\nRStudio Projects has a great git GUI as well.\n\n\n15.4.4 GitHub Desktop\nIf you are using GitHub for managing git repositories, one option is to use a desktop version, GitHub Desktop. It offers an in-between step to ease into the git lingo. Repositories become a drop-down menu. “push”ing, “pull”ing, and “fetch”ing all become a big button. It also provides a visual difference interface, which shows the changes you are making to files before you “push” them. It can’t do everything, but it provides a way to become familiar with GitHub without the (potentially) intimidating aspects of diving full-on into the command line.\n\n\n15.4.5 Is git worth it?\nWhile git is a powerful tool, you may choose to not use it for everything because\n\ngit is mainly for code, not data. It has a fairly strict limit on the size of your dataset that you cover.\nyour collaborators might want to work with Dropbox\nunless you get a paid account, all your repositories will be public.",
