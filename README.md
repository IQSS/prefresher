The [__Harvard Gov Prefresher__](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/prefresher) is held each year in August. All relevant information is on our website, including the [day-to-day schedule](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/prefresher/schedule). The 2018 Prefresher instructors were [Shiro Kuriwaki](https://www.shirokuriwaki.com) and [Yon Soo Park](https://scholar.harvard.edu/yonsoopark/home), and the faculty sponsor is  [Gary King](https://gking.harvard.edu). The booklet maintained in this repository is the text for the Prefresher. Shiro Kuriwaki ([kuriwaki](https://github.com/kuriwaki)) is the repository maintainer. 




## How the book is compiled

The text for the book is originally written in RMarkdown, which allows interweaving prose and code. RMarkdown is converted into markdown (with generated code output) and again converted into a book by pandoc. Two formats are provided: a HTML version and a PDF (generated by TeX). The HTML version is hosted on a website listed above. This format relies on the `bookdown` infrastructure.
