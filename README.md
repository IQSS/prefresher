The [**Harvard Gov Prefresher**](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/prefresher) is held each year in August. All relevant information is on our website, including the day-to-day schedule and the current instructors.

The booklet maintained in this repository is the text for the Prefresher, and is the accumulation of continuous improvements by previous instructors for the past 30 years (See the [title page](https://iqss.github.io/prefresher/) for the full list). [Christopher T. Kenny](https://github.com/christopherkenny) is the current repository maintainer. [Shiro Kuriwaki](https://github.com/kuriwaki) was the repository maintainer from 2018 to 2023.

## Technical: How the book is compiled

The text for the book is written in Quarto, which allows interweaving prose and code. Quarto is converted into markdown (with generated code output) and again converted into a book by pandoc. Two formats are provided: a HTML version and a PDF (generated by TeX). The HTML version is hosted on a website listed above.

The repository is also associated with a set of scripts that automatically compiles and deploys the new book to the URL (<https://iqss.github.io/prefresher/>). Here is basically how it works:

1.  GitHub Actions are active for this repository. The `.github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml` file in the repository gives instructions to convert `.qmd` files to markdown for TeX and HTML.
2.  Every time a commit is pushed to the main branch, it will trigger a GitHub action to run. This is the same for pull requests to merge those branches into main. Before merging pull requests, check to ensure that the new changes will compile.
