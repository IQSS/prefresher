## Counting rules

__Fundamental Theorem of Counting__: If an object has $j$ different characteristics and each characteristic has $n_j$ ways of being expressed, then there are $\prod_{i = 1}^j n_j$ possible  unique objects.

Example: Cards can be either red or black and can take on any of 13 values.

j $=$ \hspace{1.5cm} $n_{color} =$ \hspace{1.5cm} $n_{number} =$ \hspace{1.5cm} \# Outcomes $=$


We often need to count the number of ways to choose a subset from some set of possibilities.  The number of outcomes depends on two characteristics of the process: does the order matter and is replacement allowed?

__Sampling Table__: If there are $n$ objects which are numbered 1 to $n$ and we select $k < n$ of them, how many different outcomes are possible?

If the order in which a given object is selected matters, selecting 4 numbered objects in the following order (1, 3, 7, 2) and selecting the same four objects but in a different order such as (7, 2, 1, 3) will be counted as different outcomes. 

If replacement is allowed, there are always the same $n$ objects to select from. However, if replacement is not allowed, there is always one less option than the previous round when making a selection. For example, if replacement is not allowed and I am selecting 3 elements from the following set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, I will have 6 options at first, 5 options as I make my second selection, and 4 options as I make my third. 

So in counting how many different outcomes are possible, if ___order matters___ AND we are sampling ___with replacement___, the number of different outcomes is $n^k$.

If  ___order matters___ AND we are sampling ___without replacement___, the number of different outcomes is $n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-k+1)=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$.


If  ___order doesn't matter___ AND we are sampling ___without replacement___, the number of different outcomes is $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$.


Expression $\binom{n}{k}$ is read as "n choose k" and denotes $\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$. Also, note that $0! = 1$.

```{example}

There are five balls numbered from 1 through 5 in a jar. Three balls are chosen. How many possible choices are there?

1. Ordered, with replacement $=$ 

2. Ordered, without replacement $=$ 

3. Unordered, without replacement $=$ 


```

```{exercise, name = "Counting"}

Four cards are selected from a deck of 52 cards. Once a card has been drawn, it is not reshuffled back into the deck. Moreover, we care only about the complete hand that we get (i.e. we care about the set of selected cards, not the sequence in which it was drawn). How many possible outcomes are there?

```


Answers to __Example 6.1__

1. $5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125$

2. $5 \times 4 \times 3 = 60$

3. $\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{(5-3)!3!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10$






## Sets {#setoper}


__Set__ : A set is any well defined collection of elements.  If $x$ is an element of $S$, $x \in S$.

__Sample Space (S)__:  A set or collection of all possible outcomes from some process.  Outcomes in the set can be discrete elements (countable) or points along a continuous interval (uncountable).

Examples:

1. Discrete:  the numbers on a die, whether a vote cast is republican or democrat.
2. Continuous: GNP, arms spending, age.

__Event__: Any collection of possible outcomes of an experiment. Any subset of the full set of possibilities, including the full set itself. Event A $\subset$ S.

__Empty Set__: a set with no elements.  $S = \{\emptyset\}$


Set operations:

1. __Union__: The union of two sets $A$ and $B$, $A \cup B$, is the set containing all of the elements in $A$ or $B$. \[A_1 \cup A_2  \cup... A_n = \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\]
2. __Intersection__: The intersection of sets $A$ and $B$, $A \cap B$, is the set containing all of the elements in both $A$ and $B$. \[A_1 \cap A_2  \cap... A_n = \bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i\]
3. __Complement__: If set $A$ is a subset of $S$, then the complement of $A$, denoted $A^C$, is the set containing all of the elements in $S$ that are not in $A$.


Properties of set operations:

* __Commutative__: $A \cup B = B \cup A$; $A \cap B = B \cap A$
* __Associative__: $A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C$; $A \cap (B \cap C) = (A \cap B) \cap C$
* __Distributive__: $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$; $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$
* __de Morgan's laws__: $(A \cup B)^C = A^C \cap B^C$; $(A \cap B)^C = A^C \cup B^C$
* __Disjointness__: Sets are disjoint when they do not intersect, such that $A \cap B = \{\emptyset\}$.  A collection of sets is pairwise disjoint (\textbf{mutually exclusive}) if, for all $i \neq j$, $A_i \cap A_j = \{\emptyset\}$.  A collection of sets form a partition of set $S$ if they are pairwise disjoint and they cover set $S$, such that $\bigcup_{i = 1}^k A_i = S$.

```{example, name = "Sets"}

Let set $A$ be {1, 2, 3, 4}, $B$ be {3, 4, 5, 6}, and $C$ be {5, 6, 7, 8}. Sets $A$, $B$, and $C$ are all subsets of the sample space $S$ which is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

Write out the following sets:

  1. $A \cup B$
  2. $C \cap B$
  3. $B^c$
  4. $A \cap (B \cup C)$
  

```

## Probability {#probdef}

__Probability__: Many events or outcomes are random. In everyday speech, we say that we are  \emph{uncertain} about the outcome of random events. Probability is a formal model of uncertainty which provides a measure of uncertainty governed by a particular set of rules. A different model of uncertainty would, of course, have a different set of rules and measures. Our focus on probability is justified because it has proven to be a particularly useful model of uncertainty.

__Probability Distribution Function__ (Pr(A)): a mapping of each event in the sample space $S$ to the real numbers that satisfy the following three axioms (also called Kolmogorov's Axioms).

__Axioms of Probability__:  Define $\Pr(A)$ as the probability of event $A$ occurring in sample space $S$, such that:

1. For any event $A$, $\Pr(A)\ge 0$.
2. $\Pr(S)=1$
3.  For any sequence of \textit{disjoint} (mutually exclusive) events $A_1,A_2,\ldots$ (of which there may be infinitely many), \[\Pr\left( \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^k
A_i\right)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \Pr(A_i)\]


__Probability Operations__:  Using these three axioms, we can define all of the common rules of probability.

1.  $\Pr(\emptyset)=0$
2.  For any event $A$, $0\le \Pr(A) \le 1$.
3. $\Pr({A}^C)=1-\Pr(A)$
4. If $A\subset B$ ($A$ is a subset of $B$), then $\Pr(A)\le \Pr(B)$.
5. For \textit{any} two events $A$ and $B$, $\Pr(A\cup
B)=\Pr(A)+\Pr(B)-\Pr(A\cap B)$
6. Boole's Inequality: For any sequence of $n$ events (which need not be disjoint) $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n$,  then $\Pr\left( \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n
A_i\right) \leq \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \Pr(A_i)$.

```{example, name = "Probability"}

Let's assume we have an evenly-balanced, six-sided die.

Then,

1. Sample space S = 
2. $\Pr(1)=\cdots=\Pr(6)=$
3. $\Pr(\emptyset)=\Pr(7)=$
4.  $\Pr\left( \{ 1, 3, 5 \} \right)=$
5. $\Pr\left( \{ 1, 2 \}^C \right)= \Pr\left( \{ 3, 4, 5, 6 \}\right)=$
6. Let $A=\{ 1,2,3,4,5 \}\subset S$.  Then $\Pr(A)=5/6<\Pr(S)=$ 
7.  Let $A=\{ 1, 2, 3 \}$ and $B=\{ 2, 4, 6 \}$.  Then $A\cup B$? $A\cap B$? $\Pr(A \cup B)$?




```


```{exercise, name = "Probability"}

2. What is $\Pr(X=5 \cup X = 3)^C$? 
  
  
  

```

2. $\frac{1}{6}$

3. $0$

4. $\frac{1}{2}$

5. $\frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$

6. $1$

7. $A\cup B=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\}$, $A\cap B=\{2\}$, $\frac{5}{6}$

## Conditional Probability and Bayes Law

__Conditional Probability__:  The conditional probability $\Pr(A|B)$ of an event $A$ is the probability of $A$, given that another event $B$ has occurred. Conditional probability allows for the inclusion of other information into the calculation of the probability of an event.  It is calculated as

\[\Pr(A|B)=\frac{\Pr(A\cap B)}{\Pr(B)}\]

Note that conditional probabilities are probabilities and must also follow the Kolmagorov axioms of probability.

```{example, name = "Conditional Probability 1"}

Assume $A$ and $B$ occur with the following frequencies: $\quad$


                        $A$             $A^c$
--------------- ----------------    ------------------
        $B$         $n_{ab}$            $n_{a^cb}$
        $B^C$      $n_{ab^c}$           $n_{(ab)^c}$
    

and let $n_{ab}+n_{a^Cb}+n_{ab^C}+n_{(ab)^C}=N$.  Then

1.  $\Pr(A)=$ 
2.  $\Pr(B)=$ 
3.  $\Pr(A\cap B)=$ 
4.  $\Pr(A|B)= \frac{\Pr(A\cap B)}{\Pr(B)}=$ 
5.  $\Pr(B|A)= \frac{\Pr(A\cap B)}{\Pr(A)}=$ 

```

Answer to __Example 6.5__

$\Pr(1|Odd) = \frac{\Pr(1 \cap Odd)}{\Pr(Odd)} = \frac{\frac{1}{6}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{3}$




__Multiplicative Law of Probability__: The probability of the intersection of two events $A$ and $B$ is $\Pr(A\cap B)=\Pr(A)\Pr(B|A)=\Pr(B)\Pr(A|B)$ which follows directly from the definition of conditional probability. More generally,\\ $P(A_1\cap ...\cap A_k) = P(A_k| A_{k-1}\cap... \cap A_1)\times P(A_{k-1}|A_{k-2}\cap ...A_1)...\times P(A_2|A_1)\times P(A_1)$


__Law of Total Probability__:  Let $S$ be the sample space of some experiment and let the disjoint $k$ events $B_1,\ldots,B_k$ partition $S$, such that $P(B_1\cup ... \cup B_k) = P(S) = 1$.  If $A$ is some other event in $S$, then the events $A\cap B_1, A\cap B_2, \ldots, A\cap B_k$ will form a partition of $A$ and we can write $A$ as $A=(A\cap B_1)\cup\cdots\cup (A\cap B_k)$.  

Since the $k$ events are disjoint,

\begin{eqnarray*}
\Pr(A)&=&\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \Pr(A \cap B_i)\\
      &=&\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \Pr(B_i)\Pr(A|B_i)
\end{eqnarray*}

Sometimes it is easier to calculate these conditional probabilities and sum them than it is to calculate $\Pr(A)$ directly.

__Bayes Rule__: Assume that events $B_1,\ldots,B_k$ form a partition of the space $S$.  Then by the Law of Total Probability 

\[\Pr(B_j|A)= \frac{\Pr(A \cap B_j)} {\Pr(A)} = \frac{\Pr(B_j) \Pr(A|B_j)}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^k \Pr(B_i)\Pr(A|B_i)}\]

If there are only two states of $B$, then this is just 
\[\Pr(B_1|A)=\frac{\Pr(B_1)\Pr(A|B_1)} {\Pr(B_1)\Pr(A|B_1)+\Pr(B_2)\Pr(A|B_2)}\]


Bayes' rule  determines the posterior probability of a state  $\Pr(B_j|A)$ by calculating the probability $\Pr(A \cap B_j)$ that both the event $A$ and the state $B_j$ will occur and dividing it by the probability that the event will occur regardless of the state (by summing across all $B_i$). The states could be something like Normal/Defective, Healthy/Diseased, Republican/Democrat/Independent, etc.  The event on which one conditions could be something like a sampling from a batch of components, a test for a disease, or a question about a policy position.

__Prior and Posterior Probabilities__:  Above, $\Pr(B_1)$ is often called the prior probability, since it's the probability of $B_1$ before anything else is known.  $\Pr(B_1|A)$ is called the posterior probability, since it's the probability after other information is taken into account.

```{example, name = "Bayes' Rule"}

In a given town, 40% of the voters are Democrat and 60% are Republican. The president's budget is supported by 50% of the Democrats and 90% of the Republicans. If a randomly (equally likely) selected voter is found to support the president's budget, what is the probability that they are a Democrat?

```

```{exercise, name = "Conditional Probability"}


Assume that 2% of the population of the U.S. are members of some extremist militia group. We develop a survey that positively classifies someone as being a member of a militia group given that they are a member 95% of the time and negatively classifies someone as not being a member of a militia group given that they are not a member 97% of the time. What is the probability that someone positively classified as being a member of a militia group is actually a militia member?

```

Answer to __Example 6.6__

We are given that
$$P(D) = .4, P(D^c) = .6, P(S|D) = .5, P(S|D^c) = .9$$
Using this, Bayes' Law and the Law of Total Probability, we know: 

$$P(D|S) = \frac{P(D)P(S|D)}{P(D)P(S|D) + P(D^c)P(S|D^c)}$$



## Independence


__Independence__:  If the occurrence or nonoccurrence of either events $A$ and $B$ have no effect on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the other, then $A$ and $B$ are independent.  If $A$ and $B$ are independent, then

1. $\Pr(A|B)=\Pr(A)$
2. $\Pr(B|A)=\Pr(B)$
3.  $\Pr(A\cap B)=\Pr(A)\Pr(B)$
4.  More generally than the above, $\Pr(\bigcap_{i=1}^k A_i) = \prod_{i = 1}^K \Pr(A_i)$


Are mutually exclusive events independent of each other?


No. If A and B are mutually exclusive, then they cannot happen simultaneously. If we know that A occurred, then we know that B couldn't have occurred. Because of this, A and B aren't independent.

\textbf{Pairwise Independence}: A set of more than two events $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_k$ is pairwise independent if  $\Pr(A_i\cap A_j)=\Pr(A_i)\Pr(A_j)$, $\forall i\neq j$.  Note that this does \emph{not} necessarily imply independence.

\textbf{Conditional Independence}: If $A$ and $B$ are independent once you know the occurrence of a third event $C$, then $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent (conditional on $C$):

1.  $\Pr(A|B \cap C)=\Pr(A|C)$
2. $\Pr(B|A \cap C)=\Pr(B|C)$
3.  $\Pr(A\cap B|C)=\Pr(A|C)\Pr(B|C)$



## Random Variables

Most questions in the social sciences involve events, rather than numbers per se. To analyze and reason about events quantitatively, we need a way of mapping events to numbers. A random variable does exactly that.

A ___random variable___ is a measurable function $X$ that maps from the sample space $S$ to the set of real numbers $R.$ It assigns a real number to every outcome $s \in S$. 

It might seem strange to define a random variable as a function -- which is neither random nor variable. The randomness comes from the realization of an event from the sample space $s$.


___Randomness___ means that the outcome of some experiment is not deterministic, i.e. there is some probability ($0 < P(A) < 1$) that the event will occur.

The support of a random variable is all values for which there is a positive probability of occurrence.

\begin{framed}

Example: Flip a fair coin two times.   What is the sample space? 

A random variable must map events to the real line. For example, let a random variable $X$ be the number of heads. The event $(H, H)$ gets mapped to 2 $X(s) = 2$, and the events $\{(H, T), (T, H)\}$ gets mapped to 1 $(X(s) = 1)$, the event $(T, T)$ gets mapped to 0 $(X(s) = 0)$. 


What are other possible random variables?






## Distributions

The distribution of a random variable $X$ is the probability function it induces on the real line. It is given, roughly speaking, by $p(s) = P(X \in s)$ 

The formal definition of a random variable is easier to given by separating out two cases: discrete random variables when the numeric summaries of the events are discrete,  and continuous random variables when they are continuous.


__Discrete Random Variable__: $Y$ is a discrete random variable if it can assume only a finite or countably infinite number of distinct values. Examples:  number of wars per year, heads or tails.

__Probability Mass Function__ (p(y)): For a discrete random variable $Y$, the probability mass function (Also referred to simply as the "probability distribution.") (pmf), $p(y)=\Pr(Y=y)$, assigns probabilities to a countable number of distinct $y$ values such that

1. $0\le p(y)\le 1$
2.  $\sum\limits_y p(y)=1$

\parbox[t]{5in}{Example: For a fair six-sided die, there is an equal probability of rolling any number.  Since there are six sides, the probability mass function is then $p(y)=1/6$ for $y=1,\ldots,6$, 0 otherwise.}

\begin{comment}
\parbox[t]{1in}{\, \epsffile{diepmf.eps}}
\end{comment}

__Cumulative Density Function__:  The cumulative density function (Also referred to simply as the "cumulative distribution."), $F(y)$ or $\Pr(Y\le y)$, is the probability that $Y$ is less than or equal to some value $y$, or \[\Pr(Y\le y)=\sum\limits_{i\le y} p(i)\]


\underline{Properties a CDF \textit{must} satisfy:}

1. $F(y)$ is non-decreasing in $y$.
2. $\lim\limits_{y \to -\infty} F(y) = 0$ and $\lim\limits_{y \to \infty} F(y) = 1$
3. $F(y)$ is right-continuous.


Note that $P(Y > y) = 1 - P(Y \le y)$.

\begin{framed}
\parbox[c]{4.55in}{Example:  For a fair die,\\ $\Pr(Y\le 1)=$\\ $\Pr(Y\le 3)=$\\ $\Pr(Y\le 6)=$} % \parbox{1.5in}{\includegraphics[width=1.25in]{diecmf.eps}}
\end{framed}


We also have a similar definition for \emph{continuous} random variables. 


__Continuous Random Variable__:  $Y$ is a continuous random variable if there exists a nonnegative function $f(y)$ defined for all real $y\in (-\infty,\infty)$, such that for any interval $A$, $\Pr(Y\in A)=\int\limits_A f(y)dy$. Examples: age, income, GNP, temperature.

__Probability Density Function__:  The function $f$ above is called the probability density function (pdf) of $Y$ and must satisfy
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $f(y)\ge 0$
  \item $\int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty f(y)dy=1$
  \end{enumerate}
Note also that $\Pr(Y=y)=0$ --- i.e., the probability of any point $y$ is zero.

\begin{comment}
\item[] \parbox[t]{4.5in}{Example: $f(y)=1, \quad 0\le y \le1$}\parbox{1.5in}{\hfill
\epsffile{contpdf.eps}}
\end{comment}


For both discrete and continous random variables, we have a unifying concept of another measure: the cumulative distribution: 

__Cumulative Density Function__:  Because the probability that a continuous random variable will assume any particular value is zero, we can only make statements about the probability of a continuous random variable being within an interval.  The cumulative distribution gives the probability that $Y$ lies on the interval $(-\infty,y)$ and is defined as $$F(y)=\Pr(Y\le y)=\int\limits_{-\infty}^y f(s)ds$$  Note that $F(y)$ has similar  properties with continuous distributions as it does with discrete - non-decreasing, continuous (not just right-continuous), and $\lim\limits_{y \to -\infty} F(y) = 0$ and $\lim\limits_{y \to \infty} F(y) = 1$.\\

We can also make statements about the probability of $Y$ falling in an interval $a\le y\le b$. 
\[\Pr(a\le y\le b)=\int\limits_a^b f(y)dy\]

\textbf{Link between PDF and CDF:} \[f(y) = F'(y)=\frac{dF(y)}{dy}\]


\begin{framed}

## Joint Distributions

Often, we are interested in two or more random variables defined on the same sample space.  The distribution of these variables is called a joint distribution.  Joint distributions can be made up of any combination of discrete and continuous random variables.

__Joint Probability Distribution__: If both $X$ and $Y$ are random variable, their joint probability mass/density function assigns probabilities to each pair of outcomes

Discrete: 

\[p(x, y) = \Pr(X = x, Y = y)\]

such that  $p(x,y) \in [0,1]$ and \[\sum\sum p(x,y) = 1\]


Continuous: 

\[f(x,y);\Pr((X,Y) \in A) = \int\!\!\!\int_A f(x,y)dx dy \]

s.t. $f(x,y)\ge 0$ and 

\[\int_{-\infty}^\infty\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x,y)dxdy = 1\]

If X and Y are independent, then $P(X=x,Y=y) = P(X=x)P(Y=y)$ and $f(x,y) = f(x)f(y)$


__Marginal Probability Distribution__: probability distribution of only one of the two variables (ignoring information about the other variable), we can obtain the marginal distribution by summing/integrating across the variable that we don't care about:

* Discrete: $p_X(x) = \sum_i p(x, y_i)$
* Continuous: $f_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x,y)dy$

__Conditional Probability Distribution__: probability distribution for one variable, holding the other variable fixed.  Recalling from the previous lecture that $\Pr(A|B)=\frac{\Pr(A\cap B)}{\Pr(B)}$, we can write the conditional distribution as

* Discrete: $p_{Y|X}(y|x) = \frac{p(x,y)}{p_X(x)}, \quad p_X(x) > 0$
* Continuous: $f_{Y|X}(y|x) = \frac{f(x,y)}{f_X(x)},\quad f_X(x) > 0$

\begin{framed}

Example:  Suppose we are interested in the outcomes of flipping a coin and rolling a 6-sided die at the same time.  The sample space for this process contains 12 elements: $$\{(H, 1), (H, 2), (H, 3), (H, 4), (H. 5), (H, 6), (T, 1), (T, 2), (T, 3), (T, 4), (T, 5), (T, 6)\}$$  We can define two random variables $X$ and $Y$ such that $X = 1$ if heads and $X = 0$ if tails, while $Y$ equals the number on the die.  We can then make statements about the joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $P(X=x) =$
\item $P(Y=y) =$
\item $P(X=x, Y=y) = $
\item $P(X=x|Y=y) = $
\item Are X and Y independent? 
\end{enumerate}

\end{framed}



## Expectation 

We often want to summarize some characteristics of the distribution of a random variable.  The most important summary is the expectation (or expected value, or mean), in which the possible values of a random variable are weighted by their probabilities.

__Expectation of a Discrete Random Variable__:  The expected value of a discrete random variable $Y$ is \[E(Y)=\sum\limits_{y} y P(Y=y)= \sum\limits_{y} y p(y)\]  
In words, it is the weighted average of all possible values of $Y$, weighted by the probability that $y$ occurs.  It is not necessarily the number we would expect $Y$ to take on, but the average value of $Y$ after a large number of repetitions of an experiment.

```{example, name = "Expectation of a Discrete Random Variable"}

What is the expectation of a fair, six-sided die?
  


```


__Expectation of a Continuous Random Variable__:  The expected
value of a continuous random variable is similar in concept to that of
the discrete random variable, except that instead of summing using
probabilities as weights, we integrate using the density to weight.
Hence, the expected value of the continuous variable $Y$ is defined by
\[E(Y)=\int\limits_{y} y f(y) dy\]


```{example, name = "Expectation of a Continuous Random Variable"}

Find $E(Y)$ for $f(y)=\frac{1}{1.5}, \quad 0<y<1.5$.

$E(Y)=$ 


```


Answer to __Example 6.7__

$E(Y)=7/2$ 

We would never expect the result of a rolled die to be $7/2$, but that would be the average over a large number of rolls of the die.


Answer to __Example 6.8__

$E(Y)=$ $\frac{1}{1.5}\times 1.5 - \frac{1}{1.5} \times 0 = 1


__Expected Value of a Function__

___Discrete:___  $E[g(Y)]=\sum\limits_y g(y)p(y)$

___Continuous:___ $E[g(Y)]=\int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty g(y)f(y)dy$


___Properties of Expected Values:___

1. $E(c)=c$

2. $E[E[Y]] = E[Y]$ (because the expected value of a random variable is a constant)

3. $E[c g(Y)]= c E[g(Y)]$

4. Linearity: $E[g(Y_1) + \cdots + g(Y_n)]=E[g(Y_1)]+\cdots+E[g(Y_n)]$, regardless of independence

5. $E[XY] = E[X]E[Y]$, if X and Y are independent 

__Conditional Expectation__: With joint distributions, we are often interested in the expected value of a variable $Y$ if we could hold the other variable $X$ fixed.  This is the conditional expectation of $Y$ given $X = x$:

1. $Y$ discrete:  $E(Y|X = x) = \sum_y yp_{Y|X}(y|x)$
2. $Y$ continuous: $E(Y|X = x) = \int_y yf_{Y|X}(y|x)dy$


The conditional expectation is often used for prediction when one knows the value of $X$ but not $Y$; the realized value of $X$ contains information about the unknown $Y$ so long as $E(Y|X = x) \neq E(Y) \forall x$.
  


## Variance and Covariance

__Variance__:  We can also look at other summaries of the distribution, which build on the idea of taking expectations. Variance tells us about the "spread" of the distribution; it is the expected value of the squared deviations from the mean of the distribution.  The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance.

1. Variance: $\sigma^2= V(Y) = E[(Y - E(Y))^2] =  E(Y^2)-[E(Y)]^2$
2. Standard Deviation: $\sigma= \sqrt{V(Y)}$

```{example, name = "Variance"}
Given the following PMF: 
\[f(x) =  \begin{cases}
              \frac{3!}{x!(3-x)!}(\frac{1}{2})^3 \quad x = 0,1,2,3\\
               0 \quad otherwise
            \end{cases}
               \]

What is $V[x]$?
  
  
__Hint:__ First calculate $E[x]$ and $E[x^2]$

```
___Covariance and Correlation:___ The covariance measures the degree to which two random variables vary together; if the covariance between X and Y is positive, X tends to be larger than its mean when Y is larger than its mean.  The covariance of a variable with itself is the variance of that variable.

\[Cov(X,Y) = E[(X - E(X))(Y - E(Y))] \]
\[= E[XY - XE[Y] - E[X]Y + E[X]E[Y]] \]
\[= E[XY] - E[X]E[Y] - E[X]E[Y] + E[X]E[Y]\]
\[=  E(XY) - E(X)E(Y)\]

The correlation coefficient is the covariance divided by the standard deviations of X and Y.  It is a unitless measure and always takes on values in the interval $[-1,1]$.

\[\rho = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{V(X)V(Y)}} = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{SD(X)SD(Y)}\]

___Properties of Variance and Covariance:___

1. $V(c) = 0$
2. $V[cY] = c^2V[Y]$
3. $Cov[Y,Y] = V[Y]$
4. $Cov[X,Y] = Cov[Y,X]$
5. $Cov[aX,bY] = abCov[X,Y]$
6. $Cov[X+a,Y] = Cov[X,Y]$
7. $Cov[X+Z,Y+W] = Cov[X,Y] + Cov[X,W] + Cov[Z,Y] + Cov[Z,W]$
8. $V[X+Y] = V[X] + V[Y] + 2Cov[X,Y]$


Answer to __Example 6.9__:

$E[x] = 0 \times \frac{1}{8} + 1 \times \frac{3}{8} + 2 \times \frac{3}{8} + 3 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{2}$

Since there is a 1 to 1 mapping from $x$ to $x^2:$ $E[x^2] = 0 \times \frac{1}{8} + 1 \times \frac{3}{8} + 4 \times \frac{3}{8} + 9 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{24}{8} = 3$

$V[x] = E[x^2] - E[x]^2 = 3 - (\frac{3}{2})^2 = \frac{3}{4}$


```{exercise, name = "Expectation, Variance, Covariance"}

Suppose we have a PMF with the following characteristics:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  P(X = -2) = \frac{1}{5}\\
  P(X = -1) = \frac{1}{6}\\
  P(X = 0) = \frac{1}{5}\\
  P(X = 1) = \frac{1}{15}\\
  P(X = 2) = \frac{11}{30}
\end{eqnarray*}
  
1. Calculate the expected value of X

Define the random variable $Y = X^2$. 

2. Calculate the expected value of Y. (Hint: It would help to derive the PMF of Y first in order to calculate the expected value of Y in a straightforward way)

3. Calculate the variance of X.

## Special Distributions

Two _discrete_ distributions used often are:  


__Binomial Distribution__: $Y$ is distributed binomial if it represents the number of "successes" observed in $n$ independent, identical "trials," where the probability of success in any trial is $p$ and the probability of failure is $q=1-p$.


For any particular sequence of $y$ successes and $n-y$ failures, the probability of obtaining that sequence is $p^y q^{n-y}$ (by the multiplicative law and independence).  However, there are $\binom{n}{y}=\frac{n!}{(n-y)!y!}$ ways of obtaining a sequence with $y$ successes and $n-y$ failures.  So the binomial distribution is given by $$p(y)=\binom{n}{y}p^y q^{n-y}, \quad y=0,1,2,\ldots,n$$ with mean $\mu=E(Y)=np$ and variance $\sigma^2=V(Y)=npq$.

\begin{framed}
Example: Republicans vote for Democrat-sponsored bills 2\% of the time. What is the probability that out of 10 Republicans questioned, half voted for a particular Democrat-sponsored bill?  What is the mean number of Republicans voting for Democrat-sponsored bills?  The variance?\\

\end{framed}
   
__Poisson Distribution__:  A random variable $Y$ has a Poisson distribution if $$p(y)=\frac{\lambda^y}{y!}e^{-\lambda}, \quad y=0,1,2,\ldots, \quad \lambda>0$$  The Poisson has the unusual feature that its expectation equals its variance: $E(Y)=V(Y)=\lambda$. The Poisson distribution is often used to model rare event counts:  counts of the number of events that occur during some unit of time.  $\lambda$ is often called the "arrival rate."

\begin{framed}
Example: Border disputes occur between two countries at a rate of 2 per month.  What is the probability of 0, 2, and less than 5 disputes occurring in a month?\\

Two \emph{continuous} distributions used often are: 


__Uniform Distribution__:  A random variable $Y$ has a continuous uniform distribution on the interval $(\alpha,\beta)$ if its density is given by $$f(y)=\frac{1}{\beta-\alpha}, \quad \alpha\le y\le \beta$$  The mean and variance of $Y$ are $E(Y)=\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}$ and $V(Y)=\frac{(\beta-\alpha)^2}{12}$.

\begin{framed}
Example: $Y$ uniformly distributed over $(1,3)$.\\
 \parbox[c]{4.25in}{
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item $P(Y=2) = $
 \item $f(2) = $

 \item $P(Y > 2) =$
\end{enumerate}}

__Normal Distribution__:  A random variable $Y$ is normally distributed with mean $E(Y)=\mu$ and variance $V(Y)=\sigma^2$ if its density is 

\[f(y)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{(y-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}\]

## Summarizing Observed Events (Data)


So far, we've talked about distributions in a theoretical sense, looking at different properties of random variables.  We don't observe random variables; we observe realizations of the random variable. These realizations of events are roughly equivalent to what we mean by "data".


__Sample mean__:  This is the most common measure of central tendency, calculated by summing across the observations and dividing by the number of observations.
\[\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\]
The sample mean is an \textit{estimate} of the expected value of a distribution.


\begin{framed}
Example:  
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|cccccccccc|}
\hline
X & 6 & 3 & 7 & 5 & 5 & 5 & 6 & 4 & 7 & 2\\
\hline
Y & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 2 & 0\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\bar{x} = $ \hspace{3.1cm} $\bar{y} = $
\item median(x) $ = $ \hspace{1.5cm} median(y) $ = $
\item $m_x = $ \hspace{2.75cm} $m_y =$\\
\end{enumerate}
\end{framed}


__Dispersion__: We also typically want to know how spread out the data are relative to the center of the observed distribution.  There are several ways to measure dispersion.

__Sample variance__: The sample variance is the sum of the squared deviations from the sample mean, divided by the number of observations minus 1.
$$ \Var(X) = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2$$

Again, this is an \textit{estimate} of the variance of a random variable; we divide by $n - 1$ instead of $n$ in order to get an unbiased estimate.

__Standard deviation__:  The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance.
$$ \SD(X) = \sqrt{\Var(X)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$


\begin{framed}
Example: Using table above, calculate: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Var(X) = $ \hspace{1.5cm} $\Var(Y) =$
\item $\SD(X) = $ \hspace{1.65cm} $\SD(Y) =$
\end{enumerate}
\end{framed}


__Covariance and Correlation__: Both of these quantities measure the degree to which two variables vary together, and are estimates of the covariance and correlation of two random variables as defined above.


1. \textbf{Sample covariance}: $\Cov(X,Y) = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i = 1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$
2. \textbf{Sample correlation}: $\rho = \frac{\Cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{\Var(X)\Var(Y)}}$


\begin{framed}
Example:  Using above table, calculate:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Cov(X,Y) = $
\item $r = $
\end{enumerate}
\end{framed}




## Asymptotic Theory

In theoretical and applied research, asymptotic arguments are often made. In this section we briefly introduce some of this material. 

What are asymptotics?  In probability theory, asymptotic analysis is the study of limiting behavior. By limiting behavior, we mean the behavior of some random process as the number of observations gets larger and larger. 

Why is this important?  We rarely know the true process governing the events we see in the social world. It is helpful to understand how such unknown processes theoretically must behave and asymptotic theory helps us do this. 


Examples. 

__Central Limit Theorem__. Let $\{X_n\} = \{X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\}$ be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with finite mean ($\mu$) and variance ($\sigma^2$). Then, 
\begin{align*} 
\bar{X}_n = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n} \to \mathcal{N}\bigg(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\bigg) 
\end{align*} 
as $n\to \infty$. This result, known as the Central Limit Theorem, is an important motivation for many quantitative methods, as well as for the widespread use of the Normal distribution. 

Intuitively, whenever a lot of small, independent processes somehow combine together to form the realized observations, practitioners often feel comfortable assuming Normality. 


__Law of Large Numbers__. Let $\{X_n\} = \{X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\}$ be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with a finite expected value of $\mu$. Then, 

\begin{align*} 
\bar{X}_n = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n} \stackrel{\textrm{a.s.}}{\to} \mu
\end{align*}

as $n\to \infty$. In other words, $\Pr( \lim_{n\to\infty}\bar{X}_n = \mu) = 1$. This theorem, known as the Strong Law of Large Numbers, is an important motivation for the widespread use of the sample mean, as well as the intuition link between averages and expected values. 

_Important note_: The Strong Law of Large Numbers holds so long as the expected value exists; no other assumptions are needed. However, the rate of convergence will differ greatly depending on the distribution underlying the observed data. When extreme observations occur often (i.e. kurtosis is large), the rate of convergence is much slower. Cf. The distribution of financial returns. 

__Big $\mathcal{O}$ Notation__. Some of you may encounter "big-OH''-notation. If $f, g$ are two functions, we say that $f = \mathcal{O}(g)$ if there exists some constant, $c$, such that $f(n) \leq c \times g(n)$ for large enough $n$. This notation is useful for simplifying complex problems in game theory, computer science, and statistics. 


Example. 


What is $\mathcal{O}( 5\exp(0.5 n) + n^2 + n / 2)$? Answer: $\exp(n)$. Why? Because, for large $n$, 
\[
\frac{ 5\exp(0.5 n) + n^2 + n / 2 }{ \exp(n)} \leq \frac{ c \exp(n) }{ \exp(n)} = c. 
\]
whenever $n > 4$ and where $c = 1$. 

\begin{comment}
n_seq <- 1:100; numerator <- (5 * exp(0.5 * n_seq) + n_seq^2 + n_seq / 2) 
denominator <- exp(n_seq)
numerator / denominator <= (1 * denominator) / denominator
\end{comment}
